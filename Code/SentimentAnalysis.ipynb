But the recent update has been a nuisance for my pc. This has been happening ever since around 2.7 update I think. Most of the time when opening the game, it would lag so bad that when pressing the keys, it takes so long for the game to follow. Now, the game just lags in the middle of playing. My pc aint good for gaming and i feel like as more updates release, I wont be able to play Genshin anymore.\n","\n","2)I detest this game. The amount of primogems you get as a non-spender is absurdly low. To guarantee a character you want, you literally have to save a year in advance. There are so many ads about exploring Sumeru, but new players quite literally have to sit through 12 hours worth of story to even unlock Sumeru. Returning players also suffer this same issue, as there is no skip button for cutscenes and character dialogue in general.\n","\n","3)I absolutely love the storyline and all the detail that is put in is quite amazing. HOWEVER. Recently, I have had a major issue where the whole landscape is either purplish pink, or missing solid ground. I was literally standing on grass and grass alone. Ive tried restarting my device and it did not work. STARTING TO GET VERY ANNOYED. it keeps crashing, im not sure why, and all ive been told do to is go to this thing for guidelines, but i cant find it! I CANT EVEN DO DAILY COMMISSIONS ANYMORE!!!\n","\n","4)Gonna be honest I'm getting tired of genshin since it's not very innovative yet advertises itself as a game with a lot of variety for an open world game. Every update feels like the exact same just with a different colour pallette... New area, same old mini games. Same old quests. Same old events. The 2 year anniversary rewards are the cherry on the top for making me quit.\n","\n","5)Game is great, just not on mobile. I have immense lag that doesn't allow me to do co-op, has made me miss cutscenes, and stalls time trials. All graphics are off and it's just that bad. It severely takes away the experience of viewing the beautiful open world when none of it loads in and I'm forced to play with blocky graphics\n","\n","6)It's not worth it to play it on mobile, unless you turn down ALL of the graphics in settings you won't be able to play it... My phone runs good on ANYTHING else except this app, and yes I do like this game but if you're gonna play it... Do it on console or anything else.\n","\n","7)AAA production value in an f2p live-service mobile game that's also fair in giving in-game currency. The core mechanics and gameplay is great and satisfying. Looming problem is the quality of the game as time passes has been on a decline. From new mechanics and modes they introduce which are mostly just bloat, to new poorly written quests and events. As the amount of content goes up, the amount of effort, thought, and polish they do in these things goes down. Also. 2nd anniversary\n","\n","8)I love this game really it's amazing and I love following the story but the more I go into it the more glitchy and slow the game becomes and everytime I have to talk to a character it takes forever until it actually works and I've also fallen out of the world multiple times know and I don't even dare trying to teleport places anymore cause by the time I actually get to the place it would've been faster to just run there. If you don't have a really good phone don't bother downloading this game\n","\n","9)The whole game was nice but the thing is this game was developed to earn a lot you have a very low chance of possibilities to get a good artifacts and at the same time the refilling of resins are quite too long. So you can't farm a good artifacts. I wish they will change their system on how chances to get a good artifacts, it seem you need a months spending your resin to farm a 2 good artifacts for your favorite character. And this game wasn't developed for the free to play gamers\n","\n","10)The current quest guidelines is stupid, not enough hint for some quest, and tooooooooo much filler story, i dont care about most of them, and theres too much talking scene i miss the old feeling where i just fighting and exploring\n","\n","11)PLEASE MAKE CUSTOM HUD/BUTTON SETTING!!!!!......... It's very needed to mobile player,, in Sumeru Map you may use the special feature to make your move easy, but sometime its will very useless because that button will disturbing you when you want to swipe the screen at war with monsters,, that matters also make crash move(low dps) because the button doesn't in the right position you want. Please tell me if you was made the custom setting, I will back to give 5 stars and install to enjoy again!\n","\n","12)Written review has been removed countless times for giving 1 star. Genshin is actually a decent game to spend/waste time on if you have nothing better to do. Good music, exploration, gameplay and waifus. However, due to the whole anniversary rewards fiasco, i would have to give a 1 star. Now they are even going into damage control by giving the paid anniversary concert bundle as a reward. I would like to see if they are going to address this issue or just let it die down. Can't wait for 2nd anni\n","\n","13)Trying to get your hands on the characters you fond of or artifacts that meet your demand? It's simply a headache, the game can destroy your good mood, and kill your money. Yet it's really beautiful, so if you insist on downloading it, may you just stick to the stories, not the numbers.\n","\n","14)It's a very great game . Always have up dates and keep bring in good content. But I wish I was had half the luck of my friend. He gets all the new characters with easy. I spend almost $100. But I'm probably not going to get the newest 5 star, unfortunately but did get another mona. But the problem is I get so annoyed by my friend. When I should just truly enjoy the game and the characters I have already. So I try not to be as salty anymore and more thankful.\n","\n","15)In my opinion this game is best but the only problem with it is too much storage space consuming . It is my request to developers that plz add some features to uninstall the unusable maps for high ar players we should get an option To download and delete all or some maps so we can manage our storage and game could run smoothly. As if we give a closer look in game like unreleased maps the delete or in download map piamon should stop us from going to not download place and restricted teleport\n","\n","16)What is this? Everyone's getting hacked almost all of my friends and discord friends. Is this your scheme to let us play again and spend more? Ong bro this is so cringe. We be playing tons of hours just to get hacked. My friends tried their best to get their accs back for almost a year now but no response. What a waste. We are so disappointed. Hoyoverse isn't doing anything about it. I can't see even a single acc getting returned on one of my friends nor any on Reddit.\n","\n","17)I really love the game, and I love playing it on PS5. I've bought a controller just to play it on Android just to discover that the android version doesn't have controller support!! I just assumed that it had, since the iOS one does. If you ever enable controller support, I'll change this review for the max amount of stars possible.\n","\n","18)Do better with your customer service. I have been contacting them for hacked account form for weeks, filling everything with all proofs that i am the owner, sending receipts of all the purchases i have made in game yet it still says that it is 'insufficient' information and You 'regrettablly' can't retrieve it. So much for all those time put playing and caring for that account just for it to get hacked and SOLD to someone else. I trusted you too much.\n","\n","19)Game is best. But for new player it's close to never... You can't catch up.... You'll be behind... And every damn thing need quest to complete, so you can experience something new.... Questing is borring as hell..... Please provide skip option.\n","\n","20)I have been playing genshin impact since the first day they released. And had fun and enjoyed. But now it's really dissapointed playing after new updated and version released. So much lagging even my connection is strong enough to play. Now I am trying to play with every graphic low quality and until now it's lagging alot on my phone. It's really extermely suck to play now. I can't enjoy beautiful graphic environmental game.You should fix this problem and consider for player.\n","\n","21)The game is actually 5 stars. But the main problem here is domains... Im 100% sure that you don't have equal chances on substats. The amount of time and resources spent on artifacts only to come out with flat stats and no actual useful stats is ludicrous.\n","\n","22)Hey hoyoverse I have a problem in the quest Dreams Beneath the Searing Sand. I was supposed to get a keystone from a chest inside the quest but it disappeared from my inventory and I am no longer able to proceed with the quest. Help resolve this glitch or else I won't be able to ever complete this quest.\n","\n","23)Update: it has been 2 years and still no skip option for the dialogues. Save for archon and character quests, we should be able to skip dialogues in events, and daily commissions. Thought id never stop playing since ive already invested a lot, but the dialogues became even longer now. Tiring. No improvement in artifact drops.\n","\n","24)They need to fix the teleport option. There is no way, I'm going to walk everywhere to find the \"primary quest\". It's going to make me quit this game once and for all! Plus, they lie and tell you that you'll get a five star rare item every 10 wishes, but that never happens!\n","\n","25)Nice game, could greatly use some optimization and fair prices on in app purchases. Also lessening the pity system would be great too, so you know, It could be more user friendly and new gamer friendly. EDIT: The game's pity system sucks by a rating of 2/10, as there are lucky accounts. I have only 5 characters that are 5 stars despute my friends having 9 or more 5 stars on their roster. The pity system or the RNG needs to be fixed. False advertisement of the high probability on banners.\n","\n","26)Probably played about 20 hours back at launch but recently came back to see how the game has changed. For some reason my account is back to where it was at about 2 hours in, so I don't have any of the characters or loot from the other 18 hours. Plus even after claiming all the currency in my mailbox and redeeming every code I could find, I still didn't have enough for even 1 single pull. Absolutely unreal.\n","\n","27)It is a nice game, I've been playing for a year but in the latest update Everytime I go in sumeru the game crashes. My friends also experiencing this problem. I hope you can fix it soon because I can't do the new events.\n","\n","28)Nice game but impossible to get the characters we want without spending too much and it's not possible and worth to play it all day everyday just to get a random 5 star on 50/50 after months. Beautiful graphics and osts but the devs seem ungrateful to ppl on their anniversary too. Can't a 5 star character of choice be given please? Once an year isn't a big loss bruh, grow up mihoyo!! Get somee gratefulness for your players.\n","\n","29)Terrible anniversary rewards again. Other gacha games less lucrative value their players more. Those games give enough wishes to have a guaranteed 5* character . This game gives roughly 20 wishes for anniversary which isn't good for anything, and bunch of useless items. The concert doesn't equal good anniversary. Good anniversary= valuing every single player IN GAME. ... Heck EVEN TEARS OF THEMIS HAS BETTER ANNIVERSARY wth\n","\n","30)i really love this game , i have been playing for almost 2 years, however im a mobile player, and i had no issues playing until 3 days ago. i cant seem to log into genshin, no matter which server i choose, whenever its loading and reaches the \"geo\" symbol, it restarts and puts me back to my home screen. it seems that im the only one with this issue even though my internet is stable and my phone is brand new, and i have so much space left in my phone.\n","\n","31)They still don't listen to your complaints and they are very out of touch the game is beautiful and could be better but they don't really fix any big issues character move descriptions don't match what they are supposed to and if you want a guaranteed shot at a character get ready to spend around $200\n","\n","32)This is an amazing game I downloaded it for fun but then I got so invested in ut i couldnt stop. Theres one problem though Im at Adventure Rank 25 but I have exceeded the the amount of exp thoroughly but its still saying im AR 25 still. I will be happy to change my review to 5 star once this is fixed Thank you.\n","\n","33)Okay it's been almost 2 years Hoyoverse!? Tower of fancy has controller support right off the bat while genshin on Android doesn't change!! I don't get it, why is the android users not allowed to use controllers or apps that makes you use one while iphone users can? It's been ages and the game still doesn't have an Android controller support or at least a dlc for it so it's optional for the low end android players.\n","\n","34)I just can't open no matter how I reinstalled it,I even try many ways just to open this app but clearly it keep saying phone insufficient storage so many times, even though my storage isn't that full,I am so expecting to play this game even no matter how many fails I tried and tried this took me months I can't!!!played it,I just hope you fix this problem,I would have loved this but I just tired...of waiting it's just only disappointed me please fix it\n","\n","35)The game has huge problems with the endgame and the core resource (resin) as it is not enough of it to really do much. The creators also do not really care enough to improve it and also won't reward the players.\n","\n","36)Hoyoverse won't let me change my verification number on my own account, i can still login on my computer but still needs verification. I can't login on my new phone because i lost my simcard, It's been a month of waiting worst anniversary ever experienced on a game. Still no response on my emails when they do you still have to wait another week or more. Your security is getting more stupid, my binance account have same issue and they let me change my verification number.\n","\n","37)2 years playing this game. Fun to play and enjoy the game. But for me, its the most stingy game i've ever play. Multibillion company games but for 2nd year anniversary, not a single 5 star for the reward. And the best thing is, the reward is the same as last year. Lmao.\n","\n","38)Aniversary rewards were absolute shiz\n","\n","39)Very nice size.\n","\n","40)It keeps asking me to get more storage even after deleting all my apps?????\n","\n","41)try giving me keqing one more time I swear to god just delete her from the game\n","\n","42)The 2nd anniversary awards ruined this for me. Hoyoverse is becoming like Nintendo. Not giving their fans what they want. HOW CAN A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY NOT GIVE AT LEAST A 5 STAR STAR STANDARD BANNER CHARACTER?! Overall a great game and I enjoy playing it.\n","\n","43)You guys aren't going free 5* for anniversary this year either so I'm being generous enough to give 1 star rating.😇\n","\n","44)Personally it was my dream to play this game after all my old device doesn't support so I buyed a new,am happy to play this game,the mechanism is great and so far no lag issues,glad to play this honourable game\n","\n","45)just started playing like 4 weeks now and after the new update,my asian sever became more bug sometimes the ping goes from 145ms to 999ms quickly.while doing a dungeon or attacking enemy my character switching became delay and my attack on enemy doesn't effect at all while my own ho down.going to uninstall if it's continue like this\n","\n","46)Give us more rewards mihoyo\n","\n","47)I dont know why but my games keep blacking out every time i try to open up genshin so im really lost now please help 🥺\n","\n","48)The loading screen is too slow for me i have good wifi!\n","\n","49)Happy 2nd anniversary, great rewards, exciting events especially the 10% only win welkin, LOVE IT!\n","\n","50)CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE THE ELEctro hypostasis prims not be immune to normal attacks please cause I've been trying to ascend but I never can cause of those damn prisms\n","\n","51)Hahahaha anajay burik\n","\n","52)gay s÷\n","\n","53)Rigged, not f2p friendly, story, gameplay, overall is good but still watsed my goddam time....\n","\n","54)The game is great as a whole. I loved it and was the only game I played actively. Recently my account got stolen and customer service is yet to reply. I have no choice but to quit the game. I really wanted to enjoy the desert update but lost all motivation after losing my account. Cs hasn't still replied to my ticket or emails\n","\n","55)really?only 20 free pulls anniversary gift??👍\n","\n","56)can't you just give a 5star? like damn bro my pity is so high but I can't even get a 5starr?!?\n","\n","57)Right off the rip, the game bugged out and i couldn't log into my account that i had JUST created, so i had to create a NEW one. Great but i can play now, right? Wrong! I get in to this screen that asks for my agreement to tos and stuff (like everything) and then there's a permission for downloading stuff. I'm like okay, but then i see the file size (FRIGGIN HUGE) and I'm like \"Bro, who the heck has this kind of storage on their phone for a single game?\" I can't play it.\n","\n","58)never made me win 5050s 😒\n","\n","59)It takes too much storage on my phone😭\n","\n","60)P*tangina mo genshin impact puro ka clean Rami ko na nadelete bwiset🤬😡\n","\n","61)LACK OF DIVERSITY!! I have been playing this game for almost 2 years, daily. It has a good overall experience + things to offer. However, an issue that's been here from the start and has become more obvious with new releases is that it lacks diversity. Skin tones, body shapes, weapon styles and more are very, very lacking. We as a community have been saying this for almost 2 years, yet get no response and are ignored or flagged. Aside from these issues being problematic, it's just bad designing.\n","\n","62)So I really like the game, for the most part. However during the battle with the electro cube thing it would just reset and I could not beat it. My friends have also had this trouble. The rest of the game is just fine. That bug just really upset me since I need the drops from it to upgrade my characters. I understand that this is a really big game, so I have no trouble waiting for fixes.\n","\n","63)Many things about this game are great. Examples are the graphics, gameplay, and most of the lore. The biggest issue is that with the representation of characters within certain regions, dosen't feel like they were designed the way they were supposed to. (For those who get it, get it.) Another very large issue is that if you're an active player past the level of ar 50 and beyond theres not much content left for you to do if you're someone that likes to complete what they can even with events.\n","\n","64)A very fun and pretty good game, but it takes up WAY too much space on my phone. The app itself takes up 20 GB. There's also \"other\" on my phone which takes up a whole lot of space which I'm just gonna blame this game for that because I can't think of anything else it would be. After the most recent update which added Sumeru, the game has been crashing SO MUCH. I've set the graphics lower which allowed me to play for maybe 30 minutes but then it started crashing almost every 10 minutes again.\n","\n","65)The world design is beautiful, and the soundtrack is really great. But it really falls flat with the character designs with a very small range of skin tones, and virtually no difference inbetween models bodies and faces. The pace and quality that new pcs are being introduced makes it feel that the devs are focused on the quantity of characters rather than the quality.\n","\n","66)Honestly one of the best rpg mobile games I found! I live the story and the characters and animation. I would give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the fact that the game keeps crashing. I got to level 16, then as I would run or fight normal enemies, it would start to freeze up and crash. I tried cleaning my phone cache and made more space for the game. I even uninstalled and installed again but it continues to crash. So I just gave it and finally uninstalled it completely.\n","\n","67)It's a very fun and enjoyable game... at first. After maybe a week of playing, you completely run out of things to do in the world and the only real repeatable content is locked behind the \"resin\" system, which is basically just \"stamina\" from other mobile games. You only get 120 max resin, and everything costs between 20-60 resin per run. The game quickly turns into one where you log on, spend your resin in 10-15 minutes, then log out. Genshin has a lot of potential, and I just hope it's fixed.\n","\n","68)I enjoyed the game at first, the graphics are gorgeous but I am not the type to focus on storyline type stuff and half of this game is story line. You can't even skip it. The controls are okay but flying and fighting can be very challenging. I stopped playing about level 11 because I had a quest to do a task and I was supposed to kill a big monster and I couldn't do it. I kept switching and reviving characters. They were all leveled up to the max as we're their weapons. Very frustrating\n","\n","69)The game is really gorgeous and has good exploration and some other fun features. However, awful and highly unstable performance, along with constant disconnections, make it impossible to enjoy. After the November update, the stability and performance are momentarily better and less catastrophic, e.g. reconnections are short and less frequent. But the situation quickly decays, indicating perhaps a memory leak. Please continue to build on the progress you've made by fixing the disconnections.\n","\n","70)A wandering mess! Let start with the positives: English voices are great, the music is phenomenal, and the graphics are stunning! The negatives: The camera is unforgiving, The controls are directionless as if you're fighting in a compass and you have to maneuver your way back to facing north! After swinging the sword around you lose your sense of direction. There is no map just a sort of a radar that only shows symbols to where you must visit. No Thanks!\n","\n","71)Don't really get the hype. It looks pretty, but I'd say that's the best feature. There's a lot of dead time while you run around between objectives or exploring, there's very little multiplayer which in my opinion this game needs, and there's gacha pulls but there's no real incentive to pull other than to progress in your own game because multiplayer is mostly non existent. Combat is solid and should have been a more major part of the game. I got bored with exploring and running around.\n","\n","72)Played on PC : Verdict AWESOME. From the sound, dialogues and the anime-esque artstyle, everything is just awesome. The challenges are pretty varied just like the various characters. A large emphasis is laid on combining different elements (fire, electro, cryo etc). PS: camera is better on PC. On Android mobile: Camera work is bad. The camera keeps changing/rotating along with zooming into the character whenever it wants. This becomes terribly annoying especially while fighting enemies. 2 star\n","\n","73)The game has great graphics and story, but is frustrating to play without a controller (which is not currently supported on Android for some reason) while fighting or exploring the world. I would rate this app much higher if it did. It plays much, much better on PS4 with a controller or PC with mouse and keyboard.\n","\n","74)It's a great game with an interesting story. The graphics and sound is decent and you can also pretty much do everything as a free to play user if you'd like. With that being said, the way the updates trickle in and the lack of endgame makes it lacking once you've done what's available. With the recent anniversary events and just the overall way the community is treated by the developers, it's not worth giving this more than a 2*.\n","\n","75)Aesthetically, I love everything about this game. The art style is beautiful and the characters are well designed. The combat system is fun and varied. However, that's where it falls apart on mobile. If the device heats up, even slightly, the controls are too cramped to register and track properly. This is particularly an issue with any enemy that requires a lot of tactic to beat. I'm playing on a brand new Galaxy s20 Ultra, so it can handle the game. I hope it gets ported to the Switch soon.\n","\n","76)A beautiful world, and a good experience with fun gameplay at first, but later in the game almost nothing I do feels truly rewarding. The rewards are always so underwhelming and building new characters is no longer as fun for me because of how difficult it is as a result of the game's strange character leveling system and the tedium that comes with collecting the limited resources. I would give a much higher rating if it wasn't for it's major flaws that become apparent in the endgame.\n","\n","77)The quality of the game content follows a linear curve along progression. Easy, fun, well done, in the beginning. By the time you get to end game, it feels like playing a thinly veiled money making scheme. The first nation was great, the second was good, the third, released in 2.0, has been wholely lackluster. Exploration was fun for a while. Combat is designed poorly. Progress, and the game throws more enemies at you. Use a shield or get hit into five other enemies hitting you into five more.\n","\n","78)The game itself is great, on PC. The Android version, however, suffers greatly from the lack of controller support. You can technically play this game with touch controls, but it was clearly designed with other input methods first in mind. I can't give this over two stars without controller support, especially now that there support for controllers on IOS but not Android for some reason.\n","\n","79)Really cool, just too much for probably a lot of phones to handle. My phone is good quality, but it still struggles with the game. I can't even play anymore due to all the updates and having it not be able to load and all the lagging. I'd suggest making an option where you can make the graphics be less advanced for those with lower quality phones.\n","\n","80)If you love Legend of Zelda BotW, you will love this game. Pros: Fun and adventurous game, lots of things to do in the start, comic relief characters/content hold up, story is good, art design looks great. Cons: Lacks end game content, gatcha percentage pulls are waaay too low, dungeon quest entrance currency(Resin) are a joke, items needed to upgrade artifacts are difficult to find and farm, buying in-game currency are too expensive even for just one 10x pull, everything gets old after.\n","\n","81)On the surface this is a five star game that should cost sixty dollars upfront due to its expansive world and excellent gameplay with tight controls and intuitive combat reminiscent of Xenoblade 2. However, the story and world are far from complete. Attempting to reach post story progress goals will lead to an exponentially longer grind that has to be spread out over days or weeks because of an energy system that can't be completely expedited even with hundreds of dollars.\n","\n","82)I really want to play this game because they've done a great job of seamlessly making it crossplay. The PC & mobile versions are stunning. Characters are fun and it has a lot of dept for a game that feels like it is meant to be mobile focused. The reason I give the game 2 stars is because there is no controller support on the mobile version. I would happily throw money and time into the game if this is addressed in a future update. It seem an easy fix since the option is available on PC.\n","\n","83)The game is absolutely beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing, the graphics and gameplay are great. Unfortunately, 99% of people won't be able to play as their favorite characters unless they spend hundreds of dollars. It's almost IMPOSSIBLE to get the best characters and weapons, draw rates are stupid low, and prices are super high... If you guys make this system more reasonable I'll even spend some money on the game to support it, but currently it's out of question.\n","\n","84)A really good game!! I really enjoy genshin a lot and its easy to be F2P (and avoid microtransactions) with a bit of luck and grinding. Most of the events give the currency you use to buy more wishes for free, so spending money is not required to have fun, even in late game. HOWEVER, I strongly recommend using PC or PlayStation instead. Mobile is incredibly frustrating to play on as its very demanding for the device and the controls are not the best. If possible, avoid playing this on mobile.\n","\n","85)Have been enjoying playing the game on PS4 and was looking to play more on my phone while away, only to discover that the android version doesn't have controller support, but the iOS version does. Been having alot of fun with the game but as it stands I can't get the full experience from the mobile version at the moment due to something I assume would be very easy to add to the game as they have already done it fot iOS.\n","\n","86)It was fine until the recent update. I kept having to relog bcos the game kept crashing/freezing. Im not sure what was the problem. Initially i tot it was my phone storage, but storage is still 60% full.. And especially when im oncall at the sametime (i play genshin on my android phone) it crashes more often, before the update: calling on the phone while gaming was fine.\n","\n","87)Gameplay became repetitive; too much time and resources needed to invest on a single character; too much farming needed and is limited to certain points per day per week; exp gained in fighting mobs can be simply neglected; gameplay flexibility is locked behind wishes; would take months/years of dedication to showcase old characters, before you start building the newly released ones; walkthrough dependent; can be played by just consuming resin and finishing daily quests and that's about it.\n","\n","88)This game is very similar to Breathe of The Wild. I think BOTW fans will enjoy this, until BOTW2 is released. I still enjoy this game 2 years later, but the rewards for the 2nd anniversary is the same as the first anniversary. Gacha games get repetitive and should be rewarding players with better stuff year after year. This is the top grossing game ever and are greedy. They made over $3 billion (with a B) and are stingy.\n","\n","89)An incredible open-world game with beautiful characters, landscapes and ost that runs well on mobile but as someone who plays for the combat, levelling and exploration aspects of this game the ludicrous amounts of dialogue that I have to sift through in order to progress and unlock new areas (look I know this is a story-driven game but it wouldn't hurt to add a button that skips dialogue which 90% of games in this genre have) sadly ruins it for me.\n","\n","90)Used to be 5 stars. Simply put, the game is amazing for the main storyline and everything beyond that such as domains or spiral abyss is completely mindless grinding and not even worth it once you get to a level you can complete it at. Grinding new characters to experiment takes forever too. Main story is still worth playing and I do come back for new updates but new events and such are making me drop the game more and more bit by bit.\n","\n","91)Without paying anything there's a solid 90~ hours of colectathon and story content available from day 1. This was enough in 1.0, but now with 2.0 released Mihoyo has showed their true colors. Their greed took what used to be 7 day log in rewards and spread them across 30 days. The loot boxes (wishes) are predatory and you can easily get characters it's impossible to level up for several weeks until 2.0+ content is unlocked and explored first. Do not spend cash, play F2P.\n","\n","92)It's has a good story and is very beautiful but you might miss all the cut scenes because sometimes it'll freeze on them. The characters are intresting but pretty hard to get/make stronger unless you have lots of paitence/luck/money. The developers try and get close with the community but seem to not listen more than half of the time. It has alot of potential and is great artistically but is a very expensive game despite being \"free\". If it doesn't take your money it'll take all your time.\n","\n","93)I do not recommend this game at all unless you want to break your phone the first 5 minutes. Sure it looks good and has good animation but it kicks you out every 5-10 minutes or earlier and it's so incredibly laggy and the first time you play it takes 20 actual minutes in the loading screen which is really annoying. Also the second part of the glider test is impossible to do for me no matter how many times I've tried and people on yt or something shows how they do it so easily and it's annoying.\n","\n","94)The game keep on crashing. I have to reinstall the app many times and now after waiting for more than an hour after I installed it I have to reinstall it again because the resources didn't load properly. I hope this could be fixed the soonest time possible.\n","\n","95)Despite the great button layout, the lack of controller support is a huge turn off for me. Especially when present on the iPhone. 2 stars for that reason, will gladly change my review once controller support is added to the android version.\n","\n","96)Been playing since launch on both PC and mobile but mobile seems to be an awful experience 80 percent of the time. This game really needs a toggle for \"single player\" so it plays better. Recently been playing tower of fantasy on mobile and it runs better with multi-player real time users compared to genshins domains stuck at constant 999ms which don't \"require\" multi-player. Please consider a single player mode or an option to opt out of multi-player for mobile users thanks!\n","\n","97)dont get is if your on iphone i went on to the new update and started play and once i got to one of the new place on sumeru it then it took me to reconneting and i have stuck on it for 40 mins ands i have tired turning it off and it still did not work however games says for modile but its also very laggy and it frezzes a lot. however, it is a good game with cool charaters and places.\n","\n","98)It's okay a little overrated. Graphics are nice if you use a PC instead of a phone because then you have to lower graphics to play the game smoothly without lag. It may just be my phone or the internet connection I have or both. Another thing I don't like is how you have to install another app to get daily rewards. I don't play the game except to redeem them, not really all that fun tbh. But that's my experience I'm sure many others would beg to differ but it's meh.\n","\n","99)I live in Asia but my Asia ping is over 300ms why is this 😡😡, although my wifi speed is 200mbps\n","\n","100)It's so laggy since the new update, fix it.\n","\n","101)Awesome game, really good graphics and gameplay but I take 3 stars since this game still has no controller support for Android while iOs does. Do you guys have some deal with Apple or something?\n","\n","102)I don't care about the rewards so u can look good but more about the play style it sucks ngl and I use mobile and it sucks I hope u will try more for the play style and control more then giving free stuff so u can look good\n","\n","103)Very High Ping. Server location of Asia is in Tokyo. You guys should also have one for Singapore.\n","\n","104)Even with my potato phone it plays really well but there are still some room for optimization :) . Really enjoying it. Best wishes for the game's future. Edit : at first it was a good game , but now it's just boring. No endgame, nothing to do after you've explored all the maps, gacha is one of the worst, overall it's not going in a good direction. That's why it gets 2 star now.\n","\n","105)Genshin Impact Lite would be nice for 2-3GB ram :>\n","\n","106)Great storyline and art style! The characters are also really powerful and cool! But with every update the file gets larger and now I no longer have enough room for it and my essential apps\n","\n","107)Overall a good game before this patch update. But after this patch update game is very much laggy even I have all the system requirements like 6gb RAM and 128gb storage. So please fix this issue asap.\n","\n","108)There is good changes but at the cost of making every new 4 star characters worst than before even with full constellation even though 4 star character are much harder to snipe\n","\n","109)Honestly it could be better. An example of a perfect game is something like Honkai Impact 3rd or Tower of Fantasy which are amazing games, unlike Genshin Impact. I hope you atleast give us SOMETHING, that is actually nice for once, I expected more of you Genshin but you absolutely crushed my hopes. I hope you atlease give us 160 primogems per commission and please just make the game enjoyable and fun and just please add new content. Thank you -A hateful player\n","\n","110)I will add other 3 stars if you repair hoyoverse security. Because my account are hacked, and when I sent you my email, you said you cannot return my account because for security reason, what the hell? 2 stars is enough, good gameplay\n","\n","111)It's ok ig- honestly I really dc but I think they need less ads more unlocking and characters it's also quite glitchy and lots of bugs I have an iPhone 13 and it still doesn't work fix it pls xoxoxoxxx\n","\n","112)Can you please add people of color? Dragons and goblins are perfectly acceptable but melanin isn't? It's alienating.\n","\n","113)No controller support after all this time, game is cool but it can be enjoyed at its fullest when we play with a controller\n","\n","114)Ok after playing for atleast 8 months I can say this game is very good but now the game doesn't have any content left to play after AR55 you don't have anything to do other then the daily works etc. For new players it's superb but for me it's just a 30m to 45m mini game that I play every day......... every single day\n","\n","115)i beg you,remove 50/50,please,i just lost 50/50 to diluc rather than my most wanted character,i dont even use pyro,please i beg you to remove 50/50.\n","\n","116)Could've been way better, seems like the game is for putting you to sleep! I might uninstall it very soon., uninstalled!!!! Oh for the next person, be warned this is a total of over 2.5GB not 228MB that will be eaten up by this app.\n","\n","117)Fun game.... but developers are tight wads when it comes to giving out what is needed for character wishes. I mean seriously tight! Tower of Fantasy is much much more giving with guaranteed SSR drops within so many pulls. EDIT: game size is now 20gb. 2nd anniversary gifts blow donk.. Bye bye G. Impact. I'm going full Tower of Fantasy! You guys shot yourselves in the foot. R.I.P.\n","\n","118)Great game, hoping you have controller support soon .?. 2 years later still no controller support\n","\n","119)Really needs controller support\n","\n","120)The fighting grafic and everything is awesome but add a skip button!!!! Some ppl dont wanna listen to ppl talk for 1 hour they wanna play.... You owe me a new controller i taped to much on next next next it broke down\n","\n","121)Its amazing but its just WAY tk much storage my storage will be 64% filled then when I install genshin it takes up to 94% or 98% and its just to much to have please help me with this\n","\n","122)I love this game dearly but I wont be able to play after the next update because of how much space it takes up. Mobile players were kinda screwed.\n","\n","123)New update is very glitched for mobile platform, even when my processor is snapdragon 845\n","\n","124)I love the game, but since this update (3.1) it has become very buggy on my devices (mobile and PC) and i honestly don't know what to do cuz i really wanna play it.\n","\n","125)Pretty decent game has its pros and cons a awesome world, pretty nice characters, decent combat. But the questing is pretty absurd as it involvs npcs missing and u have to back track and do that specific quest to keep doing main story this kills the enjoyment from the main story.. Also the game is super not new player friendly if someone didnt do any research and summon on the new banners and get a new 5 star they will be stuck at lvl 20 until u. Actualy get to the story/map they belong to..\n","\n","126)I love it but it takes up to much space\n","\n","127)always lose 50/50 :)\n","\n","128)New update now was lagging n bug\n","\n","129)racist developers no dark skinned playable characters even in sumeru and dori's design is problematic\n","\n","130)Well this review fluctuates alot... I'll make this short. You learned nothing from last year. The players don't want JUST good rewards, we want the celebration to feel \"real\". The small mail and login reward is (somewhat) acceptable, but throw some in game event to make it FEEL like an anniversary.\n","\n","131)Tons of potential, but held back by unreasonable time gating that feels like the game barely even wants you to play. It's been an issue since launch and only becomes more of an issue as the game gets larger, but Hoyoverse never makes meaningful improvements to it. Resin requirement / time gating needs to be removed from artifact farming entirely, would solve almost all of the game's problems and would encourage people to spend more money more often.\n","\n","132)Tower of fantasy is better\n","\n","133)Hoyo, pls giv 10 more pull😑 u r not gonna bankrupt. Anniversary only happens once a year, and it should be celebrate with generous reward. Not as same like last year\n","\n","134)It's been a while since it happened, but 1st anniversary???? Good second anniversary rewards and I will change review. Also not very free to play friendly and takes up a lot of storage. The storage problem is fine on PC, but sucks on mobile. It's very laggy for me whenever I play on mobile and have to close all my other apps. Otherwise, a pretty good game.\n","\n","135)Yes, this game is good, with an interesting plot and lore. But the graphics are a little too extreme. Yes, I know, this game is getting beautiful sceneries with a high set of graphics, but I cant help but get a lag spike even when it says that the graphics are good to the point its smooth. That, and the fact that sometimes after fighting enemies, I find myself not being able to chat. Either way, a cool game, with beautiful sceneries and amazing characters that have an interesting lore.\n","\n","136)Gameplay is great, world is beautiful, even with limited graphics, and characters and their designs are amazing. However there are numerous problems. Lack of content besides from limited events, artifact grinding taking a copious amount of time, etc. However, the biggest problem for me right now is how often the servers disconnect. My WiFi is fine, I've changed it before, and my phone ran it fine before. This issue makes the game almost unplayable and it happens way too often(every 5-15 minutes)\n","\n","137)The game is good, has a story, world, and characters that keep me coming back, and I play regularly on PC. But it turns out you kind of need a relatively newish phone to play the mobile version. Granted, my phone isn't super old, but the mobile version shouldn't be so unstable that it's a gamble if I can even get past the title screen. It feels like while this is a good looking game for mobile, it's the fact that it's so graphically intensive that keeps it from being playable on mobile.\n","\n","138)Overall, this game is amazing! I originally played on my computer but it always lagged. I later downloaded it on my phone and I've had a few problems; My amount of damage won't show, everytime I go near water, it glows at a certain angle & distance, and more. After asking other players on different platforms, I found out that this isn't just a me problem, but a problem for most of the android genshin players. I'd love to get any information to help with this problem, or someone to fix it\n","\n","139)This game is absolutely amazing! Incredible graphics, an amazing storyline, and interesting characters. However, my phone can no longer hold the game. The amount of storage this takes is ridiculous, and I'm going to have to uninstall because I'd like to have other apps on my phone. If you really enjoy genshin impact, it's ultimately better to play on a different device. It runs very smoothly and storage is not a problem when I play on PC!\n","\n","140)The game is really fun. Very entertaining. But I have some concerns, I don't know if it's just me but when I first downloaded the game. The quality was perfection. But now it's very blurry and blunt, and the sound crashes a lot which makes me suddenly get out of the game. And the storage is a huge problem. after the 2.7 update my phone just couldn't take it so i had to uninstall. but it does run very nicely on my pc or ipad without any problems.\n","\n","141)Very good game, great graphics, story, and characters. My only problem is that when I launch this game, my phone overheats like crazy, making me only play for maybe 2 to 3 hours at a time. I don't even have a bad phone and it still over heats. If this problem was resolved I would rate it an easy 5-star.\n","\n","142)Edit- until my android is able to use a controller with this game, its no longer viable. Difficulty ramps up and i cant keep up on touch controls. It was fun while it lasted. Been playing this on phone and pc since release. This game is not just good. This is art, this is a quality triple-A game, that can be played for zero dollars. For once, I feel GREAT supporting a game through an occasional microtransation. I pray this game goes for ages.\n","\n","143)The game is overall good. Love the story so far & where it's going. My only complaints are the gacha system & the visuals, really. The game isn't F2P friendly at all; the rates are kind of low, & it drains the wallet. While the view in the game is extraordinary, the vastness of the game can deteriorate the quality of gaming. EDIT: There's also definitely a lack in variety now when it comes to the characters. Besides the new update, there's little opportunity of new, interesting team builds.\n","\n","144)It's a gorgeous game in the graphic department, the battle system is great, but the it doesn't support using a controller instead of touch controls, it only supports it in iOS, so that's why it deserves 2 stars less, if I can't control my character easily, the the awesome battle system is less enjoyable in mobile, so I tend to prefer the PC version.\n","\n","145)it is a really fun game, just recently i have had some issues. First, i do play on chrombeook, because finically it is the best i can do, but it crashes after preparing to load data. Second, there isnt any controller support, and it is stuck using the mobile layout, which is a pain for non touchscreen devices. Third, and finially, there are some asset files that simply dont download, for example Dvalin is wings, crystals, and glowing eyes, no neck or body. Overall i love the game, but cant play.\n","\n","146)Great game with great visuals and game play! EDIT: After playing quite a bit and spending a lot of money, it's extremely hard to get any characters anymore. I've done several 10x draws but only come up with weapons. In fact, two of my draws pretty much gave me the same sword for all ten pulls. I don't know what was done to the chances, but I'm not spending $200 or more just to get a damn character.\n","\n","147)My internet works fine, I put my data on when I play, and I can not log in. I could play fine before 2.7 but not anymore. Sure, I lagged sometimes but not like this. When I get to the door on the loading screen it just kicks me out. I don't know what to do. I decided to delete it. Alr so I deleted it and redownloaded and it's all good now so yay! :))\n","\n","148)It's a fun game. I've played it on ipad, PC, and android. I'm giving 3 stars because out of all the platforms I've played this on, android probably the least fun. The no controller support is a deal breaker. Using a controller is the main way I enjoy playing this. I really like genshin impact. It just frustrating there's no controller support on android.\n","\n","149)The first couple weeks playing the game feel phenomenal since the story is amazing and the progression is great. After a while though, it gets repetitive and content appears once in a while. Players have been having problems with lack of 2FA and lack of action against hacks. Feedback allows you to state concerns, but players tend to get back automated messages and nothing official. Changes may occur randomly and the F2P friendlyness is okay I guess.\n","\n","150)Incredibly predatory pricing scheme, where after your initial monthly purchase, you will get up to ten times less premium currency per dollar spent. It is hard to overstate just how maliciously designed the monetization system is, so I strongly encourage you to look into the rates for \"Genesis Crystals\" per dollar spent before you consider playing this game. The game is fun, beautiful, and has amazing story and music, but I cannot in good faith recommend new players to sign up.\n","\n","151)The dialogue is a bit slow and cut scenes can't be skipped. But the game is fun. A bit tedious on grinding for the mat's for Wishes (character/weapon summons) Best part is being able to carry your account from platform to platform Update: would also like to add that the game needs a Fast forward option for the dialogue. A Skip feature for Any/All cut scenes, better camera management during Combat (it's constantly sinking into the Dirt) and characters get knocked over by the SlightedOf breezes\n","\n","152)It's not for me. For starters, I don't understand the appeal of generic anime art, but thought it was worth a try since it's so popular. I don't enjoy the strange character switching mechanic and can already see how they will make buying characters seem necessary for many players. While I'm fine with games having some micro transactions, I think it should only be for fluff. I'd rather buy a game outright. Even so, it ran very smoothly on my tablet and the sheer size of the map was impressive.\n","\n","153)This is so slow xD changing characters is slow, running is slow, the glide takes you straight down instead of letting you fly. I love the art, the effects, and things to do. But mannn it's so slow, there's so much space to drive around but no vehicles. I love that I can skip, but I live the fast life, is there a character that's built for speed? I can't wait to explore more and see what else there is tho!\n","\n","154)Lovely game, amazing graphics, great story line but, there are *many* flaws. First off, there should be much more representation in this game. There are few characters that aren't snow white. And every character is thin. Second off, players don't get as many rewards as they should. And third off, the game gets very boring, very quickly. I am AR 53, achieved every quest, every event, and much more which just makes the game less fun. I personally would love more world quests. Thank you.\n","\n","155)The story, art and music are top tier! But it has problems too 1. The bugs as most games have which can be dealt with. 2. Some quest are locked behind a daily reset and are triggered only of you teleport to a certain location, please make it so that this isn't the case as we miss out on them. 3. It's the anniversary, release some cost halving or exp double events, not just blossoms, they would know which ones are better, yet they are stingy. Plan better with this stuff. (not good enough tbh)\n","\n","156)Beautiful game, beautiful music. I wouldn't recommend if you aren't prepared to grind. Don't expect to get Characters unless you grind and save (for at least 2 full updates) or spend money. Artifact system desperately needs to change. Many characters are in need of reworks and/or buffs, I'm hoping they'll eventually do something about this, but I doubt it will change. After a certain level, playing often feels like a chore and can lose almost all enjoyability.\n","\n","157)I've been playing this game since 1.6 and the gameplay, graphics, world-building and the characters are all great. However, this recent update has been less pleasant since the game would often crash. At first I thought the problem is my device but after hearing from my friends that they also experienced the same thing, I hope the devs would fix this soon. It really discouraged me to go back at the loading screen again.\n","\n","158)One of the best action-adventure game I've played, but the gacha system sucks nowadays. Maybe my account's luck is just so bad. Still, new contents were amazing. I hope there's just more rewards specially for long time players. It kinda burns me out considering the huge list of available character nowadays but never even had a weekly reward system that will help to build more characters. Even the battlepass rewards are lacking.\n","\n","159)I had installed genshin on my phone, it was fine. Now I've been trying for last 3 days to install it on my Samsung tablet but no matter how much space it has, it does not work. Stop giving us that pop-up screen that says \"hint\" not enough storage. Just tell us how many gb we need instead of that 'quirky' pop-up screen that annoys the hell out of everybody I don't know what the bug is that makes it so it doesn't like Samsung, but you need to fix it cuz I like gension but it's frustrating\n","\n","160)The game is really good but my problem is that id lag every single time and i have a really good phone and the storage it take makes my phone full really fast also i have experienced many bugs in the game and with these kinds of problems i dont think i can enjoy playing this game because of lag but i really like the graphics, the story and the characters! id give this a 5 star if only i would stop lagging and such.\n","\n","161)Game is good and I love the stories, quests and characters, all of them but except for one thing for low-end PC's or phones. The long loading just ruins it for me and you might know why. It's so triggering, right when the wrong moment comes; picking up something either they run away or when the loot from the chest rolls down and fall, plus when you try to open the map, adv book, characters, etc. It loads soooo long while you watch your character die from the monsters or fatui.\n","\n","162)The game is really really awesome. I would recommend everyone should try it. The only two hassles are the huge 15 GB download at the start and the fact that it's really hard to get the character you want. I think we ought to be able to farm at least 100 primos per day using commissions. Other than that you'll really enjoy the game. It's fun and addictive.\n","\n","163)I have two major issues I want to stress out.. 1) Re-model the weapon gacha system (it's a downright scam now). & 2) Tone down the dialogues. It's becoming a tell-tale game with each updates... If that's the developers are aiming for, at least input a SKIP option!! A friendly advice to the developers, Dear Hoyoverse, make the enemies/fights more challenging. Puzzle isn't everything..............\n","\n","164)The game is really nice and a change in mobile gaming. The missing things are: No optimization for Android, i have a better than average phone with a cooler so i can play 2 hours on medium 60 fps. Another thing is controls, If you swipe the screen to look around the arches aiming mode are turned on, it will be good to have a solution for accidentally touched button while swiping. Also the side quest are repeated and kind of annoying.\n","\n","165)visually and combat gameplay wise game is impressive . but the gameloop itself is very annnoying and boring. all you do is some random(same) daily quest over and over and some farm ressources here and there. then wait for resin to recover or continue main question (if you have still). weapon upgrade and char upgrade is simply pay to win. no real objective for player to loging everyday to play like in older mmo. all you can hope is you get something good in gacha and which happens rarely.\n","\n","166)I really like the game, but it gives me anger issues sometimes when you don't know where to go even with the marker of the quest since it doesn't show you the path into some caves or out and such specially with the trees and grass limiting your vision to see much in them. Plus you should be more generous with characters. A free 5 star of your choosing for instance when you start.\n","\n","167)Hello, I'd like to make a complaint on why I can't see the damage/elemental texts in Android and it is very useless to build our characters if we can't see the damage. There are also other graphic problems like the grass and ice because I can't see them, the health bar of my enemies disappearing If I activate 5 star bursts. Other than that the game is wonderful and fun, please kindly fix the problem thank you.\n","\n","168)Great game, great graphics, fun reacton system, cool character design, bad resin timer, greedy company, zero communication, zero transparency. If you want a game to play for 5+ years, this is it! just make sure you don't do all the story in one go because you'll get burned out. Let yourself be lost while traveling the world. As for me, as a player since release, story and events eventually end and i only log in to do commission and use up all resin and im out. Which is just sad...\n","\n","169)I loved this game when I was playing on mobile, but my ipad broke, so I haven't been able too. When I noticed that I could download it on my Chromebook, I was so excited, but everytime I try to log onto it, it goes to the \"Hoyoverse\" part and then just exits out by itself! Can someone explain what's happening?\n","\n","170)Epitomized path is glitching and only gave me 1 point for 3 5 star pulls. At first I thought it was a translation issue since I'm newer to the game. That maybe it was 1 point for every 2 weapons but a more established player informed me that's not the case so this will stay 1 star until the fix the issue.\n","\n","171)Here's my honest opinion. Love the game, play it 24/7 whenever I get the chance to. The story is very interesting and fun to look into and the characters are beautiful! I love the design of them. But when we get into the gameplay and like events and rewards that's when we start to go off key. Well the events are fine{Some}. But rewards... What this game lacks is communication with it's community. At some poiny the community had to go to BIG lengths to get the dev's to listen. Just fix that pls..\n","\n","172)The game is fun, and surprisingly f2p friendly and good quality despite it's reputation as a gacha game. But 2 issues, 1 issue is that you can get a character affiliated with a state in a lvl 30 zone, but can only progress to lvl 20 before needing items from the 30 zone to upgrade further. So if you get a character that isn't affiliated with lvl 1-29, you get screwed over. 2nd is that despite being a single player game, requires a stable internet connection. AFAIK there's no way to go offline.\n","\n","173)The storyline is stunning just like the views you get to experience , character design and combat animations are amazing! But when it comes to gacha , well , wishing it's absurd how in 6 10 pulls I only got 2 new characters and Amber , the single pulls only give you weapons at this point. I'm also from the EU but because of texture problems (pretty much every where , esp on stormterror) I had to abandon my AR 30 and switch to Asia where the textures work for some reason?\n","\n","174)I love the game, really, it's just that it pisses me off how bad the rng is, specially for the artifacts, but that's just me. What is really bad for anyone that plays very often is: where's the endgame content? Exactly, besides gacha, resin, dailies and abyss there's none (which may sound like too much but it's limited by time; either daily or weekly). Please add something else.\n","\n","175)Good gameplay and really impressive world scale. Incredible that it's f2p. I don't mind the grind sometimes and when I find I get bored or am stuck, I just put it down and come back after a few weeks or more. The main problem I have is the lack of diversity in characters - physically, regarding skin tones, body shapes, hair types, etc - and diversity in game items - like weapon types/combat styles across characters. For a fantasy game, there is very little fantasy in the design of these things.\n","\n","176)This game is very vast and beautiful. The storyline is engrossing and entertaining. I enjoy every game feature but the advancing through the story while obtaining characters and advancing them is extremely uneven. You are forced to buy characters to be able to defeat difficult bosses because you need drops from those bosses in order to advance certain characters. Its very disheartening. And the difficulty is getting harder and harder. Its sad because the game is soo beautiful.\n","\n","177)Been in the gacha game circle for years and was mainly here for that, getting into it by one of my friends who plays more pvp than I do. I can say it's been really fun so far for an open world mobile! It's so much fun to explore and see how the story unfolds for these past years, making memories along the way. Due to not only design and event problems though, it's rough to get the full story by not being pay to play. The grind is tedious if you want to flex, but other than that, its good.\n","\n","178)No physical controller support. Lowest settings is very demanding in good hardware and overheats the phones. Been playing since launch and this still happens. Also, very very very grindy and it gets stagnant real quick after each update. We want more storyline hehe. Make protogems from dailies at least to be 100 per day...\n","\n","179)This game is normally a 10/10, 5* review quality game bc the open world is amazing, combat is perfect, character designs are good. BUT recently the game has been plagued by disgustingly incessant time consuming puzzles. If you are going to create an entriely new extremely complex puzzle the least you could do is make a better tutorial to explain its mechanics. Update, the sumeru/dendro addition has been amazing and works extremely well w how it acts with the other elements.\n","\n","180)Beautiful game and want to play but just can't keep my self playing right now without controller find the touchscreen not quick enough with the camera feels slow but graphically beautiful please add controller compatibility please !!!\n","\n","181)So now with Sumeru released, I'm having so much fun exploring the map. The area and music and story are fantastic (if a bit long sometimes with A LOT of talking). I only really dislike Genshin's lack of skin tone variety. We need more diversity. Character designs are starting to lack severely in that regard. Also, with the second anniversary, we are again getting pittance to say thank you for our support to the company. As a multi-million dollar company, I expected more.\n","\n","182)So far so good, a bit laggy sometimes but overall it's good. The only problem is that it randomly kicks me out of the game? I don't know why, my internet is fine and my phone could manage it well yet it just kicks me out randomly. It's getting a bit more annoying especially when I'm actually getting into the story.\n","\n","183)For the love of god, stop reiterating the same blatantly obvious plot point every half second, effectively using 2 paragraphsto explain something that can be said in a short sentence. Or at least add a fast skip button so that we aren't forced to read something 50 times that would lose a 2nd grade writing competition.\n","\n","184)The characters and gameplay are amazing! However, I think the quests are too wordy when trying to get points across. I just got a Heizou, but I can't use him as is because I don't have Inazuma unlocked yet as a new player, which is really unfair and makes everything harder.\n","\n","185)I've been enjoying the game a lot like the graphics are so beautiful and the characters look pretty but recently my genshin crash by seing the hoyoverse screen then kicked out of the app. I tried redownloading it it didn't work. Please fix this bug :(\n","\n","186)The game itself is not bad. Certain characters that have been in the game for over a year still have issues with their skills not working. I have submitted feedback times but it seems the company is too large to listen to feedback. It is sad to see cool characters become unusable due to these bugs that could be easily fixed if the company cared. Many people know about the issues and talk about them on the official subreddit but still no fix.\n","\n","187)It is a really good game with the stories, character design, and places to visit here. The only issues I have experienced while playing this game was mostly the insufficient storage space warning that I get every update. I have other apps that I have on my phone (which is what I play on) that I do use, I don't have money for a pc and im not going to delete every app on my phone just to play a game. Other than that this game is very highly developed which I like. Nvm I'm good now\n","\n","188)Great game, great graphics , and great story. I've been playing over a year now. Tried to do all the archon quest and some world quest. But the problem for me is that many quest have way tooooooooo loooooooong dialogs which really is annoying, I keep clicking, to skip, but it still take a long time. I hope that you give some players the option to instantly skip the dialogs. For that reason l am giving it 3 star for now.\n","\n","189)I have been playing this game for already more than a year now. My account just got hacked and even though I already contacted Genshin customer service via email, I received no reply other than the automated ones. The game is great but I don't suggest playing it and even spending time and money on it because despite the company's success, they don't make much of an effort to protect their players from hacks and even help retrieving the account.\n","\n","190)Well it's an amazing game I really loved it and the challenges a hoot! Just to say that some of the quests I do won't let me give the npc's the things it needs like the quest talk to the chief of konda village. Please try to fix that but overall good game!\n","\n","191)I love this game but when you ask for help in feedback it's useless info. This time I asked that an objective doesn't appear when I approach it. THRICE. On separate days. The response I got was 'Go watch YT tutorial'. That's not the kind of help I want. Others times I asked the responses where just 'look around' or 'just log out and back in'. Do they think I haven't done so before asking? So 'help' they are.\n","\n","192)The game is getting better but it still lags a lot. Sometimes while I run or walk, the whole thing freezes all for a minute and unfreezes which is very annoying. This is a the top thing I would liked fixed but nice game.\n","\n","193)Fun game, but its a bit painful if you're free to play let alone putting any less then 10 dollars a month. UPDATE- So the more I play this with friends, the more I notice a flaw this game doesn't seem to really address. There is almost no incentive to play with others. Unless you're being carried though a domain or a event is going on you really have no reason to do so. Maybe a increase in drop rate/amounts with a increase in difficulty for domains when in multi-player would give you a reason..\n","\n","194)Great game but lacking a specific feature it should of launched with, controller support! Would make the experience so much better with a controller, a game that's been out for over 2 years and still no controller support. That aside the game is good (on pc/console) alot of enjoyable moments, runs great on my Sony but I can't recommend this for mobile use due to the reason stated above. It needs that controller support but if your used to touch controls then crack on, you'll enjoy it.\n","\n","195)The camera work is very wonky in Sumeru. Most of the time during battle, you'll get to watch blades of grass (since you can't constantly adjust it's angle in the heat of battle). The \"Lost riches\" event isn't well thought out either. Enemies tend to get blown away from you, the \"energy balls\" spawn too far away - sometimes there's a delay in spawning the next batch of enemies. I'm giving up on this event.\n","\n","196)Best game in terms of plot, graphics and mechanics. However it totally disrespects player time: a lot of grind with timegates is required to get usable character on high levels: around month. Tired of grind and pissed of by fact that I will never be able to use most of my characters. Timegates on resource farming give nothing but irritation. Same for energy system which single purpose is bring even more irritation in single player non competitive game.\n","\n","197)The game itself if great. But it's annoyingly cruel is you're a good sniper. Even if you got a character from far away, their health just regenerates. The battle only counts when you're in the enemies range not the other way around. Also there waaaay too much dialogue in the story. Like waaaay too much rambling by characters.\n","\n","198)The game is good.. but only if you haven't ambition because the RnG system is super ridiculous and the devs don't want to change anything. I stuck with some artifacts for months though I have some good 4* pieces I can't ascent them into 5* because there's no such function. My time is going to nowhere everyday, every week and even every month since I got only trash artifacts with the same repetitive domain. Boring. The most successful cross platform game is just a bait to sell you pixels for NR.\n","\n","199)Amazing game!, everything is so good but there's a problem sometimes some of the quests will get buged and I was not able to progress,so please fix it and in my first account i experienced this and it was the archon quest so I didn't get to progress please fix it.\n","\n","200)I love genshin so much. character designs r great. main problem here is the HUGE storage it requires. which game even requires 16GB of storage?? I'm sure hoyoverse can work something out. my 128GB phone can't take it no more, much less those with 64GB😭 had to delete the game a few times already bc of storage problems\n","\n","201)A very good game with good graphics, superb music and a wonderful story. However, it is clear to me that the people working on this game have no intention of diversifying the character roster. Hoyo continues to take from other cultures to inspire its nations, and yet cannot go beyond 2 skin tones. This game would be much better if new characters had more skin tone diversity.\n","\n","202)2nd review. After the recent update (ver 3.0), the game become way more laggy, and starts to stutter constantly which ruins my experience in the game. Before the update, the i have no issue with the performance so I'm assumed the issue have something to do with the latest 3.0 patch. Hope the developers will do something about this.\n","\n","203)I love this game- really, I do. The story is great- the animation for big scenes are absolutely beautiful. I mean seriously- this game has great graphics. But there are big issues in this game that others have criticized time and time again that Hoyoverse simply has not acknowledged seriously. The diversity issue- especially with the new Sumeru update! Artifact system as well has been a huge complaint, and difficulty has been a huge issue in inazuma. Good game- hoyoverse just won't listen.\n","\n","204)Its a good game with lots of puzzles and adventure very addicting game but there's things that make me upset like 1.power creeping: its a problem not most people care about but for some people there favorite character will slowly be unusable in the coming months and new characters will thrive in the meta, making people uninterested in playing. 2.not listening to the community: hoyovers is known to not listen to the players especially with character bugs fix or character buffs they never listen.\n","\n","205)The game is really good. I really like the character designs, the events, the fighting style of characters and enemies, but there's just one problem that is pretty big. There's barely any diversity. There are only three confirmed dark skinned characters in the game. Plus, every playable character is not overweight nor underweight. So there just isn't enough diversity in the game\n","\n","206)It's a great game, though it took 4 hours to finish loading when I first got it. I'm not exaggerating.. it took four whole hours, once it finished the voice acting was rather glitchy, and it was just super laggy, but after the first part it was alright!\n","\n","207)i am now considered a veteran player to the fanbase sitting at ar 56. this game is no longer enjoyable. i found myself at a distaste for the lack of model variety. the game and characters are still very well done. but there's a major lack of communication between the company and players. playing the game is like doing homework for school, there's characters who are extremely similar it's funny. a lack of diversity for something that's based off the real world with real cultures and religions.\n","\n","208)How to Make Genshin 5 Stars 1. Double all primogem sources (daily commissions, quests, chests, achievements) except for events 2. Add more teleporters or give the player a magical creature to ride for faster travel 3. Add offline LAN mode + cloud save upload so players can play genshin offline 4. An option to have unnessesary dialog (such as the story) be automatically skipped 5. Less characters that use thier abilities then are swapped off asap 6. Changing META 7. More puzzles in the open world\n","\n","209)I had quite a lot of fun. Then I hit somewhere around 4 minutes and 17 seconds of gameplay and immediately headed out. You see, there's no controller support on Android. I know that this is a small issue but I'm not a huge fan of touch controls. I really hope it gets changed sometime.\n","\n","210)It's a good game with amazing characters, but I got bored of it quickly. It's sort of repetitive in a way, where everyday it feels like you're on a task to do the same things you've been doing over and over again. I think it would be more enjoyable if you actually pay attention and get into the storyline. Decent game 👍\n","\n","211)I've been playing this game for nearly a year now. It has been a really fun experience and I really like it.Sadly a big problem for me is that there are barely any actually dark skinned charakters. Even the darker ones still have quite light skin. I would really like some really dark skinned charakters in the future.\n","\n","212)A small review, because I can only write 500 words. Graphics: They are great. Story: Is good, but Sumeru feels like it's dragging on and most characters are uninteresting. Weapons: I almost don't have a chance to get copies, same goes for the characters. Artifacts: It's still the same issue, I can't get good artifacts. Leveling a character is easy, same goes for Talent. World: First when I start playing, it wasn't so great, but with the Sumeru update, the world feels like its somewhat alive.\n","\n","213)as of the 2.8 update, game is slowly improving. Things still need to be tweaked, especially QOL updates. I can't recommend this to new players because I worry about whether or not they'll be able to farm the materials needed for certain characters, especially Inazuma.\n","\n","214)Any BOTW fan can tell how solid of a game Genshin Impact is, truly a gem of a game. Everything's great gameplay wise, but on mobile there are some performance issues, one that bothers me the most is how hot the device gets in 60FPS mode, if hoyoverse can fix that, it would be so awesome, but a game of this caliber on mobile is awesome already. And also, I wish there was a SEA server so we could have lower ping.\n","\n","215)Currently only the app (800mb) can be moved to an SD card while the data (17gb) cant be, which is the stuff it installs one you're in the app. If there could be a way in-game to move the data to an SD that would be greatly appreciated because my phone barely has any storage left.\n","\n","216)This game is amazing! The graphics, music and the story too! But there are somethings that disappoint some players,It's when you get your AR too high and want to save some Primogems you won't find players to grind since you're an endgame player you won't have a choice but to spend money, oh another thing, building charecters, grinding artifacts is sooo heard almost everything that you get isn't a good artifact, you maybe could get a good artifact of farming for 2WEEKS or more, I would review a5*\n","\n","217)It's a great game. Great characters, great lore, great aesthetics, great music etc. What's not so great is the fact that it is unfortunately a gacha game, meaning that the game earns money based on what essentially boils down to legal gambling for in game characters and weapons. Another not so great thing IS THE FUCJJINF FISHING MECHANIC LIKE MIHOYO HOYOVERSE WHATEVER WHYYYYYYY\n","\n","218)I'm so frustrated with this game tbh. There are so many aspects that need to be improved. Hoyoverse is actually scared of fully clothed women. The weird cultural mashup that is sumeru, not to mention orientalism. Laggy, story is only interesting like 1/3 of the time and lacks entertaining content. Dont even get me started on the wishing system, it's incredibly unfair. The reason I'm giving it an extra star is because of it's beautiful animations and landscapes.\n","\n","219)I love this game, I used to play it all the time bit took a break because there wasn't anything to do and it started feeling like a chore. Now, since I've re downloaded it it keeps crashing non stop.\n","\n","220)A great game that makes me want to invest some time into it, however makes it near impossible to do so due to the energy system (resin). This makes especially less linear farming, such as artifacts, extremely lengthy with very little rewards if you get unlucky. Overall I'd still recommend it however would also make clear that this isn't a game you can easily pick up and get everything quickly (alone due to special 5 stars that appear like twice a year at best). you're okay with grind? go for it.\n","\n","221)Game is so nice to play and I really loved it. The graphics, gameplay, characters, story, and lots more. But only one issue which I am always facing is highly consumption of storage and internet, because for mobile version, I am unable to spend 16 to 17 GB. That's the main issue I am facing. Please reduce the storage size of the Game.\n","\n","222)Very good game!!!! Gameplay, story, graphics!!!! Perfect!!! I just think the characters aren't as cool as the ones in honkai impact. They lack a bit of eccentricity in them. haha And it lacks skins.\n","\n","223)The game is fine overall, there are nice characters and the world is very complex, though there are some issues. It is too time consuming trying to get good artifacts, new characters and generally doing long quests or puzzles. Also, some characters are whitewashed\n","\n","224)Look this game is good and all but commissions wise you get bored doing the same things over and over again and when youve finally reached endgame meaning that theres not a single chest to unlock you kinda start drifting away slowly but still having to do all the commsions and at the end it kinda becomes a hassle you stop using your resin and you stop caring about primos while still fighting the urge to do your comms you will get it when you reach endgame urself for now enjoy your new journey\n","\n","225)I wish there were more POC characters coming out for sumeru, especially Candace. All of the redesigns where characters were darker fit more with their designs as well as where sumeru was based off. Honestly, if Candace was the same shade as her inspiration, I would spend my whole life savings to get her. I also wish it was easier for FTP players to get primogems. With more characters coming out, reruns, and double banners, it's not fair to FTP players\n","\n","226)There is a lot of work that can be done considering the long term of Genshin Impact. Power creep of older characters will be a big issue for them soon. And the rewards could use a big buff. The game content is constantly getting harder, yet the rewards stay the same. Aside from that, Genshin was and still is one of my favorite games. Everything about it is charming. I love it and care for it and hope to see Hoyoverse do good things with it, and listen to the community more.\n","\n","227)It's a very good game I played on my PC there's one problem with mobile that I think is happening only to me I can't login my account on my phone it keeps saying account or password error I put the right email and password but goes again and again reinstalled it a few times but it be going the same end\n","\n","228)For a game that touts so many unique playable characters from the story, they sure make it hard to get them. And I'm not talking about pulls, I'm talking about limited banner runs that take months to a year to come around again with no other way to get characters you want. I enjoy the story and would happily pay to get characters like Venti and Childe but I dont even have the option. (I'm only in Liyue story btw)\n","\n","229)It's been a while of playing, and I only hope the artifact system gets better anyhow. The story and everything else related to characters are always of great quality, the things behind that though, need a lot of polishing, like the Abyss, to make it easier for newer and less punishing to new players.\n","\n","230)I have been playing this game for so long i started playing in 1.6. if you are not prepared to grind dont play. i had to buy gems once in a while and the money is defenitely not worth the amount of genisis crystals given. the anniversary gifts are not very fair and banners dont stay up for long so if you dont buy, and to get enough primogems, you would haved to grind for around 3 months prior (even more) to about a 30% win. if they were a bit more generous with primogems i would play more.\n","\n","231)I love it! Sure there's a little less to do later in, take it from me who's AR 59, but it's still very fun! I enjoy the way it looks and plays quite a lot. Yes, it's hard to get 5 stars, and you might not get the one you want. But it's just a game, yes it's fun, but it's a free game. I'm very happy with it for the fact it's free. Could have better research put into some characters for sure though (definitely sumeru ones) but overall, it's okay. Again, fun, but just okay. For a free game.\n","\n","232)THE GOOD: Good game, addictive, fun, good characters and nice graphics, the combat system is fun and the animations are cool, the gacha is OK but free prymogems are hard to grind. / The BAD: Censorship sucks, progression system is too slow, resin system is very limited and the artifact grinding is annoying and tiring, any other grinding is just like any other gacha but again resin is hard to get and slow to recharge.\n","\n","233)I play on ps4 and mobile, and it's great. All of it is perfect except the fact that it randomly kicks me out while playing. I have absolutely no problems on my ps4, but it normally takes about 5 minutes after I enter the game for it to kick me out. This has happened for a VERY long time and, honestly, I'm surprised you haven't fixed this yet. Im not sure if it's my phone that is not working well with the app, or what, but I have a Galaxy S20 FE 5G. Please fix this, thanks!\n","\n","234)For a while now, (maybe 3 months or more) my game has started freeze up out of nowhere even though I would have good internet. I already cleared out cache and uninstalled apps I no longer needed. I don't know what is causing the freeze up but can I have some advice on how to stop the freezing? This hasn't happened before when I first started playing Genshin. Thank you.\n","\n","235)The game is fun, and the storyline is great. I've been playing for quite a long while now. There's a downside, however. The game is always so laggy for me, and my pings aren't even high, I really hope Mihoyo can fix this.\n","\n","236)I really want to give this 5 stars. It's absolutely gorgeous and I'm already very engaged in the story but the control interface is just so awkward it's downright frustrating.\n","\n","237)I love the game, it's beautiful, the story line's are amazing, it's brilliant. But honestly, it takes up way too much space, and takes way too long to download. It's not even done yet and takes up half my storage. I feel like when it's finished, you'll need nothing else on your phone but Genshin Impact just because of the storage needed. Other than that I love the game\n","\n","238)Ping is getting very high with every update. I used to get 80-90 ping when game launched and now it's 350 ...it's unplayable please fix this! I use 300mbps connection which worls really great in all other games i alsocheck ping with other net providers but its was the same with genshin ..always high ping .I do love the game ..iPlayer it from day 1 but ping issues killing it for me. I hope u guys will do something coz I really love this game .\n","\n","239)great game !!! i rlly love the lore n charas :) though these r more personal tho , it could prolly have somemore chara ascension materials in the shop since some ppl dont have a lotta time to farm for them n some can be a lil hard to find ! also the storage kills my phone but its reasonable considering how big the game is ;_;\n","\n","240)While this game is amazing it has a few flaws for on chromebook , don't get me wrong its a good game i have it on my phone but for chrombook it's not that great, First of all i spent over an hour trying to get past the intro. I'm still not past it due to immense amounts of lag the screen is also blank. I have no clue what happend either. Another thing is on chrombook you should add pc controls or the option to change them instead of just having moble controls, thanks!\n","\n","241)Amazing art. Nice story so far. Fun game play. Beautiful world. BUT THE THING THAT RUINS THIS 5 STAR. The gacha system will eat your money. BEWARE WHALES. And it's very completion heavy to progress. Massive grind. Even in earlygame. But again I bow to the artists who design these characters.\n","\n","242)The game is great, but there's some problems. Here's some of them : 1. The rewards are very low. Increase the daily commission primogems to 80 instead of 60 Increase the spirla abyss (floor 9,10,11 and 12) rewards to at least 1600 And increase the anniversary rewards. 2. Fix the artifact RNG (prioritize crit rate%, crit dmg%, attack%, energy recharge% elemental mastery) and remove the flat sub stats. 3. Add more endgame content and add more Spiral abyss floors 4. Fix the co-op experience\n","\n","243)Good game but for new players, they can be locked out of most current and upcoming events due to being level requirements and story requirements. Still have alot of issues and some characters have problems that has still not been fixed for 2 years, and some being minor not being fixed. Good game, but the company isn't great at managing the game's current state for endgames and new players.\n","\n","244)it's a very Good Game And Has Good Graphics but I Noticed Some Bugs Been Trying To Beat A Level And I Also Lag Very Much The Screen Freezes I thought my game crashed after it freezes it starts again it bothered me for some time now\n","\n","245)Sure, the game has amazing graphics and is easily the best free game, though I do not like how I have to delete all my apps just to play and for it not to load me in. The amount of storage it takes up is unbelievable and unnecessary. I would play if it would allow me to, it's been sitting in my apps for around an hour while I try to see if you guys have a discord sever. Please fix this problem.\n","\n","246)If I could remake this game myself I would, but I'd really only change problems with artifact rng and character obtaining methods. Other than that, I'd probably redesign a boss or two, but that's about it. Maybe there are a few things I'd change otherwise, but I can't really list them right now. Overall pretty good game, chool character designs and stories. Toxic loud minority fanbase (especially on Twitter) but I mean it's Twitter what do you expect.\n","\n","247)Very fun and engaging in a way that doesn't feel manipulative. I love the lore a lot and the soundtrack is breathtaking. Would be 5 stars if not for Dori.\n","\n","248)I can't give it a good review. It's a beautiful and cool game, but the lack of controller support on Android kills it for me. I don't want to play it until that feature is added.\n","\n","249)The update is great! But can you guys optimize the game for mobile devices? Also add an option to customize the controls for a much comfortable gameplay.\n","\n","250)Honestly the game has amazing plot and great character designs (most of the time) excpet i do hope that hoyoverse adds darker skin tones. Nahida was one of the biggest disappointments know to this is game i really hope the newer archons get better\n","\n","251)This game is great! With the only downfall being how big it is. I understand there's a lot but it is beginning to be too big to play on mobile. Pls try to make it smaller!\n","\n","252)I absolutely love this game and have played it for more than a year it's amazing however the updates are so frequent and need lots of storage and as a phone player It gets taken so easy by genshin otherwise the games great\n","\n","253)Its a really fun , high quality, and It doesn't lag much but I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 bec. It's kinda confusing but after you get familiar with everything it it starts to become really addictive, it does take up alot if storage and memory , but it's worth it regardless I'd say this game is awesome, a top recommendation for sure!\n","\n","254)Its amazing! It's fun, the gameplay is amazing, the lore etc. I cant give it 5/5 stars tho, because of the characters, I wish some of them would be darker-skinned and have appropriate skin tone when it has an obvious cultural clothing\n","\n","255)edited rating;; i really enjoy this game and all, but it takes up a lot of space on your phone. i had to delete the app because im unable to play \"because of low storage\" while my phone space is completely fine, and doesn't cause a problem at all; its bc the game uses up way to much space on my phone to comfortably play. but im lucky im able to play on ps4. aside from that, im really looking forward to scaramouche's banner. good luck to you all on your pulls!\n","\n","256)The gacha rate is terrible. Edit: To be fair, music and animations of this game are great. However, the gacha game companies really need to be transparent about the rate if they want some credibility. We really need a law to force the companies to open source their gacha systems. Edit2: But the game trailers are insanely good. It deserves 2 more stars...\n","\n","257)I've played for almost all the way from the beginnings of this game debut. The most fun games to play, but be reminded that this game as others RPG games need you to grind for your character to become stronger. That also become problems as the grinding needs a lot of times and some of the materials to level up really get so hard to get. I know this game required player to pay for top notch characters and weapons, but make it easier for leveling up so that it became more fun to play.\n","\n","258)Wonderful game. Insane graphics and we're allowed to explore in feeto explore in free time, it is amazing. My problem is the struggle to log in. I'm even scared that I may have lost my account now and might not play again if you leave the app and you come back in it's like time reversed by a few seconds and I have to repeat what I had used done\n","\n","259)I like this game a lot and almost play it every, the scenery si beautiful the mod has great design, and many characters are design well but the problem is that after 3.1 update i had some bug/issue that i have encounter. First, my notice has \"failed to load notices\" few days ago and second is it just me or the feedback just got longer loading? I hope you get this fix sooner it's getting annoying right now, pretty much many ppl also experience this problem.\n","\n","260)u needed to load too long but over all it's a good game\n","\n","261)The experience was great but as update goes on, it consumes storage.\n","\n","262)Before the update.. the game runs great on my s10+ but after update.. it started to lagged and crash.. Please fix\n","\n","263)Happy second anniversary Genshin even though I have been on extended hiatus from the game do to grind burnout, my point from the first anniversary still stands... seeing miHoYo grow from a 10 person indie developer, to a full fledged 3rd party AA developer delivering some of the most impressive free to play games in one word \"Inspirational\" this game proves with every new release the that boundys of what a free to play game can do.\n","\n","264)So I think this is a bug if you know the quest purify the large crystal I did all 5 but it tells me I've only done 4? I even checked running around there's nothing I have missed now I can't get farther into the quest please\n","\n","265)I'll give it 3 stars because it takes 20GB from my phone snd if yall do more updates I'll just quit till i get an pc for gaming but that will be in some years because im low on money\n","\n","266)I think this is a great game but I only have it a 3 star cause it would be great if they put a trading system and a taming system here that's why I thought\n","\n","267)Overall, the game is fine but the community is very goddamn toxic also lack of endgame for lategame players (literally nothing to do in ar 55+ expect commission domain etc) also anniversary rewards still suck\n","\n","268)Reason: Can't create an account Lag Still loading while my wifi is great\n","\n","269)its good\n","\n","270)Pretty much legend of Zelda but it's free\n","\n","271)hoyoverse why my ping always 200+ even though my connection is good?please fix this,really love to continue my adventure without any laggy issues\n","\n","272)Game has been crashing non-stop with the latest update\n","\n","273)Please Lower the graphics, so that low end devices can be able run the game.\n","\n","274)I love genshin and i love to play while i am out and about but it would really begreat to have controller compatibility on android devices. Why is it that is 2022 ios is the only mobile devicethat has it.\n","\n","275)Haven't even started yet and there's a huge in-game download............just make it part of the main download\n","\n","276)Good Game ....... But the content is a bit repeating\n","\n","277)Great game, great story, great soundtrack. But worst rewards that any gacha game has to offer. Sadly..\n","\n","278)It's a nice game, but wants too much storage. I currently have 16gb of free space on my phone and cant get the latest update. Wth MiHoyo????\n","\n","279)It is an amazing g game but I'm just Mas because I did 2 ten pulls and got weapons and 2 favonius codex it wasn't even the weapon banner u pulled again and got horibbl2 things and not one character I'm being petty by giving it a 3 I love the game and all but come one I had 92 pity\n","\n","280)The new update 3.1v is great but it made my gaming experience way more badly because it's way too laggy for me, I barely even move It was smooth on the previous version 3.0v but this new update ruins it :c\n","\n","281)I like the game but i have to delete it because when i play it's turn so laggy i can't even play smoothly in realme 5i I hopefully it will be fixed\n","\n","282)The World is like fun LAG\n","\n","283)works, phone heats up pretty fast though. i like playing on mobile just to play my instruments uvu\n","\n","284)I want to play and I deleted most of my storage and I can't still go in🤷‍♀?3\n","\n","285)Its a good game but its not letting me play it?\n","\n","286)I've been experiencing more lag than before. Please genshin reduce the lag\n","\n","287)Add more pins to the game. We still have the same amount when the game first started. We have TWO ENTIRE NATIONS NOW. WE NEED MORE PINS. ADD MORE PINS TO THE GAME.\n","\n","288)I wish that there were side quests that can get u a legendary weapon but it's great\n","\n","289)I absolutely love the game but had to delete it because it was to much data. i would love if it could come out on Nintendo switch.\n","\n","290)If you start playing right now AR 1, you will have 2 months at best of 10/10 content, but then it becomes just a chore.\n","\n","291)Awesome game but facing ping issue in india\n","\n","292)It annoys me so much that you made it so difficult for us to import our wish history. You don't even keep it for more than 6 months. So, why can't you just allow us to import it on our own?\n","\n","293)could be better\n","\n","294)The game is great, but its area is very large, and I deleted the game because of this, although it is fun and wonderful, but the only problem is its area.\n","\n","295)It's very nice\n","\n","296)I have put feedback, I am just waiting for you guys to see it if you guys can reply that would be amazing\n","\n","297)I really like it and i used to play this in a different acc, but I deleted the app, after 1 year, i started ro delete my photos, my apps and I still cannot download the data since its insufficient storage.\n","\n","298)Its ok..it took up ALOT of space and the game isnt the best i like the story line and how its made but for me its laggy.

Great for escaping from reality and your real life responsabilities\n","\n","302)It's ok I guess. Multiplayer needs a rework tho.\n","\n","303)Decent, good gameplay. But the resin wait time need improvement, or atleast higher caps because how hard it is to farm artifacts and other things\n","\n","304)This game is amazing,but for us mobile players it's unavailable...Now with the 3.1 update I can't play the game because I don't have enough space,for example the iPad I own only has genshin on it yet it fills up my space without the full download being completed\n","\n","305)Hi it me again is this normal l had 3516 primogems and l did a 10 pull and it took 2000 primogems is it normal please help me\n","\n","306)4 star because idfc about the rewards, all i want is the story and also the only thing why i give 4 star is because we can't customize the joysticks and the skills Update: i put 3 stars now cause i have a good connection but it always error 4201\n","\n","307)I just enjoy it but can not play anymore bc i have no more space and i can find it on the app store my tablet but still very enjoyable game would recommend\n","\n","308)I love the game but why do you have to make a 16gb download can you please make it like 5 to 6 GB's please I deleted all most all of my stuff for this\n","\n","309)needs more improvements in it's resin and wish system, and also you need to stop releasing intentionally broken characters and making problems within their sets when they wouldn't be overpowered without them in the first place (characters like Yomiya and Yae Miko)\n","\n","310)Game is phenomenal but hoyolabs should reduce the size of the game and of updates. Very important\n","\n","311)Just a little more communication and this wouldn't be happening right now.\n","\n","312)Its a good game.. but i accidentally pressed clear data😭. All my progress is literally gone probably idk yet its still loading well bless me i guess...\n","\n","313)This is the best game so far, but after the update the game began always crashing. Please fix it.\n","\n","314)The game is nice and I love it, but there is one problem that it is not in the Arabic language. I wish they could add it\n","\n","315)I'm phone is going to be begging me for mercy like Shawn Mendes once this new update is done.\n","\n","316)good game with good graphics...still very limited options for free to play ( very little for just 160 resin caps and little freemos )\n","\n","317)love this game a lot. story, character designing, everything is so good. there is so much turkish players in the game and we need turkish SUB !\n","\n","318)this games need more spaces\n","\n","319)Takes a lot of space, if there was an option to delete completed quests it would be nice.\n","\n","320)Game's good, but has its flaws. Also hasn't worked in my laptop for the past 3 months.\n","\n","321)It's an amazing game but it would be better if the mobile version was a bit smaller.\n","\n","322)you know exactly what those two stars are about.\n","\n","323)This game has great story, amazing graphics...it's playstyle is too good ...and now they have second anniversary so why the rewards r too low 🥺..if they increase the rewards i will increase my rate also\n","\n","324)Love the game! It's amazing and graphics is great. The only problem, I recently upgraded phones and the first time I tried to download the files, it crashed around 85%. On the second go, it worked fine. I think that if you made the Google Play download larger, it would be better, maybe not the entire game, but maybe low res assets and other things so you could immediately play and it would download the high resolution assets later/in the background. Overall though, it's great!\n","\n","325)It's an INCREDIBLE game that I've been playing for a while. The controls are really good for a mobile game and I was delighted to find out how huge the open world is. There's so much stuff that you discover, even after having gone through an area many times before. I wish there was more diversity in the characters, like different skin tones/body types and such (instead of just thin adult and maybe-a-child?) and there are occasional glitches (2 of the same npc during a cutscene) but overall 👍\n","\n","326)The release of Sumeru gave so much to do! I've been playing for over a year. It's got amazing graphics and tons of different characters to choose from. The story has got us anticipating more. Although it is captivating, it isn't really new player friendly. The new characters and weapons require items that new players can't have access to. It can cause them to rush through the story. Other than that however, the game has been treating us nicely. I hope the second year anniversary won't fail us.\n","\n","327)Definitely a great game that's made great strides compared to the first time I installed it. It's still very laggy especially as the game includes more, but it's improved. It's not very free to play friendly though. For the amount of characters coming out, the spacing of events and primos possible make it very difficult to achieve getting characters. I experienced this in a major way as a beginner because of the large gap in what I wanted versus what was possible.\n","\n","328)I love this game so much! It's absolutely amazing! The graphics and game play mechanics are bizarre. Every single vision holder design is so detailed and pretty 😍 Really the only problem I have is how much storage it sucks up from my tablet. It really is a hassle when I have to delete so much to play Genshin. Overall it's really amazing 👏\n","\n","329)It is amazing, I have only been playing it for a few day, it been lagging a lot, might be becuse of my storage 😅, but all I need to say is, it's amazing! The art style is amazing too, 9/10, when you change to another app for even a second or keep it open in the background, it just puts you back on the menu screen, for a person who dose like, 5 other things on their phone at the same time, it's a problem, nothing truly bad to say. 9/10, Love it\n","\n","330)This game is truly amazing and getting better day by day, though it has many bugs and features that could be fixed for a better game experience. 1- My major issue is the storage this game is taking. Im not sure if there's a fix for it, but it's getting out of hand and many (mobile) players are being forced to fully quit. 2- On mobile, most times the chat will not open or glitch in coop, which is annoying but it usually comes back after a few seconds. Though, its overall a great game, I love it.\n","\n","331)Would be a 5-star review if Android had the option to use a controller. Game is very expansive and you get a lot for free. Wishes can be spendy cash-wise but you get plenty of opportunities for free gear if you play consistently. Graphics are great and run smooth. Story is unique (to me at least). Gameplay is simple and effective. Again, if we could use controllers, easy 5-star. Accessibility is lacking because of this.\n","\n","332)Updated Review: The game has pretty good quality (music, art, VA, etc.) updates that have been consistent for an entire year. The game is fairly easy to navigate and there's a decent amount of content for new players at this point of the game. However the bad part is it's getting a bit taxing on your system the more updates they release, so you might need a high end computer to run it.\n","\n","333)The mobile version doesn't do this game justice, it's much less laggier on console and on a good pc. The graphics are amazing on those platforms, the music is great and the story is great. However once you complete the story there is next to nothing to do and it gets repetitive very fast. It's very difficult to earn primogems so in order to actually have a great experience with the game, you're basically forced to spend money on it.\n","\n","334)It's an amazing app but it's getting hard to continue to play on mobile. It's taking up a BUNCH of storage. Infact, after 2.7, I'll have .04 GB left. Plus, as new characters come out, older characters dont have reruns as much (ex-Kazuha) and the lag on mobile is frustrating. But I do like the idea of an ascension quest. It helps me prepare for higher leveled enemies and let's me stay at a world level I'm comfortable at. The graphics are also absolutely wonderful! They're beautiful 😍.\n","\n","335)Absolutely LOVE Genshin! The storyline is great and the graphics are amazing. I rated it 4 out of 5 stars because the apps takes up a lot of storage which makes the game lag when loading in new areas. On a side note, after the 2.7 update my phone didn't have enough space to play the game anymore and I don't have a PC to play on either, however I do have a chromebook. The issue is that Genshin isn't supported on chromebook, so can the developers please make the game accessible to other devices :)\n","\n","336)This game is gorgeous and fun and so easy to lose track of time playing. I get really sucked into the world. It does take up a lot of space, but I feel it is absolutely worth it. I have it in my phone and on my ps4. Though playing on mobile can be really tricky at times. I recently learned I can connect a Bluetooth controller to my phone, but there is no setting on mobile for a controller option. 😕\n","\n","337)Great game, I wish it were easier to get primogems so players wouldn't have to decide between skipping three banners and paying high amounts of money for the characters they want, but that probably won't be changing. Also the resin cap, both condensed and regular, are painful. Resin recovers excruciatingly slowly, and then the condensed cap makes it difficult to do much without stopping all the time to make more. Excited for the future though, I guess. The music and landscapes are beautiful.\n","\n","338)This game is mad fun. Great characters, gameplay, world, design, it's great. The MUSIC is absolutely bonkers good. I docked a star because there are some blaring issues that haven't gone away. Hoyoverse listens to the player-base sometimes, but some problems will probably never be fixed. These don't bother me, I have lots of fun with this game as long as I don't make it a chore.\n","\n","339)i love this game a lot. great story, great gameplay, all the characters have their own story and its super engaging. however, the storage it takes is a little ridiculous. im being forced to quit because my phone cant handle it. its a really good game! i hate to quit, it just takes too much storage. hopefully a version for nintendo comes out.\n","\n","340)Superior cross play capabilities that are ahead of it's time. I can get off the PC and play on my phone with very little to impact the gameplay. Beautiful story and design and very little bugs! Game is 100% enjoyable FTP. Only thing I can think of to improve is to add gamepad support for the Android version, I use a dual screen phone with programmable gamepad options, but for those using products like the Gamesir X2 are out of luck. This lack of support is my one star penalty.\n","\n","341)I love genshin ever since I downloaded it back in the end of March of 2022! But with the recent 2.8 update it keeps crashing on me and lagging bad time, as in I'm just trying to do a single commission and it crashed on me twice in just an hour, I play on mobile(Samsung s10e) and my phone is completely up to date, and I've never had any problems before, so I'm just wondering if it's just my phone or if it's with everyone else. Other then that I love this game and it got me addicted quick lol\n","\n","342)it's amazing! has good graphics, and fun lines when you stand still for too long. The downside's that it takes up lots of storage space. And when I got the next two characters; it would lag so bad that even pulling up the map would cause it to stop working. while getting Kaeya and Lisa, the frame-rate declined significantly, making my gaming experience worse. So I hope that they'll work on that for mobile devices. As a gamer, I'd like for this to be addressed so everyone's experience is better🤗\n","\n","343)honest rating. at the beginning of the game it's pretty fun, theres so much to do and it's very enjoyable. although there are a lot of things to learn, you can figure it out later on. overall, the events, maps, and story is amazing. when you reach ar 50+ there might not be much to do and some high level players get burnout. the gacha/wishing system is horrible. the resin system is horrendous. co-oping is fun af and you can meet new people. overall, I would not reccomend to a friend.\n","\n","344)I absolutely love this game. The graphics are amazing, the lore is amazing, the characters and their stories are interesting, just about everything about it is amazing! However, the game has a huge lack of diversity. Just about all of the characters (that aren't NPC) are skinny, and every one except for 2 playable characters are paper sheet white. I feel like adding more diversity into Genshin Impact would make the experience so much better!\n","\n","345)the game has a great lore and plot, but idk if its just my phone or if its the game. so everytime i play, its kinda slow but im somewhat fine with it. but then a few mins later when im trying to switch characters, it either wont change or a few seconds later it does but then reconnects the server, same with fighting, healing and all that and its getting rlly annoying otherwise its beautiful and has a good story to it\n","\n","346)This game is overall good, although, At some points in life, the game would stop working. After updates it would just shut down or you would not be able to enter the game. It would make you download it again and take up MASSIVE amounts of space when you already had it downloaded and an account. For me, this is a big problem that I feel like can be fixed! I think this game is perfect otherwise. <33\n","\n","347)I love this game so much!! It's an easy game to start playing open world games. I do have a few things I would love to see changed though. The first be the rng of the artifact system. It's a bit to luck based. Give us a way to set which artifact sets for each character. The next thing is the lack of endgame content. The abyss is a fun and challenging activity for me but that's the only thing that is rn. I would love to see more floors added to the abyss or even more world levels.\n","\n","348)Perfect controls, clear instructions, clean gameplay, awesome graphics, and music. The gameplay is 💯❗but their system isnt the best... Their weapon is extremely f2p UNFRIENDLY, forcing you to do 2x the amount of wishing you have to do on character banner, and that is just to get to guaranteed. Another thing is the lack of poc, they did the typical anime game move and made 98% of their characters light skinned, and their poc characters don't have much screen time. Besides that this is top tier!!\n","\n","349)I really like playing Genshin Impact, its really fun and I like exploring and building my characters. The only issues I have with the game is the lack of diversity, and the lagging, and how much time it takes for an update to get done. I try and play on my mobile phone, but for the past few updates, I've had to get rid of apps and clear my space on my phone because of how much space this one app takes. Other then those issues, all is good, keep up the good work Hoyoverse.\n","\n","350)Great game and the character, settings, and stories are beautiful and well made. This game quickly became addicting with it's quests and characters. My only complaint is the mobile version lags a lot and , especially when wifi glitches, I can't switch characters nor do enemies take damage when this happens. However, I still enjoy it and will continue playing the game!\n","\n","351)I enjoy this game. Realistically it's fun, interactive, has great music and an interesting lore. My main problem I have with it is that the story is not immersive enough, and considering that the game isn't finished that's understandable. I would like to feel like the story is progressing everytime I play them game instead of waiting for every update for an archon quest to give me a crumb of progression. But still enjoying the game for what it is, Genshin delivers a lot for a free game.\n","\n","352)This game is very amazing and entertaining the graphics are perfect and I would give it a five star but I have one problem when I play for some reason the game freezes and kicks me out randomly and it make the game really slow but I still think it is amazing for ipad or pc. It also take up too much data I had to get a second memory chip so I could download this and keep my other apps besides all of that this game is perfect.\n","\n","353)It is a really good game. the graphics and the music are just beautiful. I do think it takes up quite a bit of space but it is worth it. I think this game really makes an impact(hehe get what I did there) on myself. Most of the time(when I'm not fighting monsters) it's very calming and fun. I definitely would recommend! :) <3\n","\n","354)Fantastic world, absolutely beautiful music, amazing artwork, lovable characters. Some things they need to work on are the monetization methods and coop features. Devs should make getting first copy of each character easier to get and cheaper, and instead focus more on the optional constellations and costumes to make money. The coop experience is still very limited and should be expanded to allow greater variety of fun content to be regularly coopable. More in-game events would be nice.\n","\n","355)It's definitely a cute and fun game, definitely worth a try if one is bored. My only real grievance with it is that it's hard to get any characters. Primocrystals take forever to accumulate it be much better that if you get 15 or 20 as rewards instead of 5. I quit once before because I could never get any decent characters or I got more weapons then I ever needed. Other then that pretty fun.\n","\n","356)there is a lot i love about it, great characters, beautiful setting, interesting story. but it has some drawbacks mainly the repetitive nature of a lot of the smaller quests, especially the daily ones, go do this small thing that is exactly the same as the last time, which very well might have been yesterday. but the biggest change id like to see is making the 10 pull more meaningful, tons of gacha gamrs like this make it a 10+1 pull just doesn't feel worthwhile to save for the big one.\n","\n","357)Great game. Good Graphics, adorable characters. Just one problem, the game is too expensive. Like, I understand you need to make money, but it can cost up to 50 dollars just for 1 5 star, and a bunch of 4 stars, and bad weapon pulls. Please make it more easy to get 5 stars, you dont have to make it too cheap, but lower the price of things.\n","\n","358)Re writing ✍️ Hi! I I'm in love with this game spend many hours on it but it took up so much storage I couldn't update one of my games and get a game I payed for (very little nightmares) so yes I did Uninstall it but now I just about to play it again fresh start etc and it was good the graphics are really good but the more I played the graphics got worse it became extra laggy in fact it took an hour to even start up the game! I mean it's a huge game but it's a waste of time..\n","\n","359)The 2.7 archon quest is amazing. The quality increased greatly compared to past ones and character interactions were done masterfully. I feel in game rewards need to be increased when it comes to both mora and primogems. Getting the five star character you want can be VERY expensive in this game; the free in game rewards should be adjusted for the free-to-play and low-spending players. There also needs to be some kind of resin adjustment because artifact RNG can cause hopelessness.\n","\n","360)I've been playing for like 3 weeks and It's one of the best mobile games for me. The only problem that I have is after the update I've noticed that the frame rate of the game has gotten worse and even when I'm just roaming I can feel the jerks (in fights it can get even worse). It was running fine before but now these little problems made my experience unpleasant than it was before. I'll continue playing because I love it too much but I hope that the team looks into this\n","\n","361)after the release of sumeru, this game has become so full of life! the map design and exploration is wonderful as always. the newest quests are also fun and enganging, and it makes me curious what will happen next. not to mention the music~ it's so good! however it also brought some bugs; such as landscapes not properly loading which made my characters fall through the map, then there's some constant crashes happening every hour and it slowly annoys me. i hope it could be fixed next update qwq\n","\n","362)I love this game, I've been playing for a year and a half and it became a part of my routine. Only problem I have with it is how hard and tasking it is to obtain characters without paying money. Not to mention all the farming required to level up a character and how hard it is to get good artifacts...I lost motivation at some point because of that but I always end up coming back every update lol :^\n","\n","363)The game is very beautiful and the elemental reaction mechanic keeps the game fresh. Really breathtaking scenery and wonderful main and event story too. Not to mention the nice and detailed aesthetic of the caharacters too. It's just that the end game content feels pretty lacking and limited. It is especially frustrating with the resin system in it. Other than that, it's kinda unfair for new player that meaningful event story is timegated within limited amount of time. if u miss it, u miss it\n","\n","364)Great game for a \"Mobile Game\" but I suggest that I rather play on PC/PS if the game keeps crashing and having glitchs on mobile devices, it just means that the mobile device can't handle the game so you need a stronger phone. It would be great too if we have a resin free content to do especially for the players who are at Adventure Rank 50-60 or World Level 7-8 that's all I have too say for now and really a great game to play but still can be better.\n","\n","365)Gameplay and graphics are pretty amazing for a game u can play on a phone. I really dig the landscape and overall aesthetic of the world. The story, although cliche in some aspects, does it's job of immersing you in the world and fleshing out the characters. BUT premium currency is scarce and equipment grind is insane. I need to save for 2 months to get characters I want as a light spender, and it then takes me another 2 months to build the characters i get to an acceptable level.\n","\n","366)I have played this game a day after kts release and I was the best experice ever to play this open world rpg. From the graphics, music, lore, characters, and overall world building is just amazing. I would love to continue to play until the traveler reaches the end of its journey, but the problem now would be the space required for mobile phones with each update its getting more difficult. I hope their is a way that mobile players can still continue to enjoy and play the game in future updates.\n","\n","367)Overall its an addictive game, from gacha to puzzles and many more. The thing mihoyo should also add up to genshin for a better experience and gameplay is configuration of controls. Yes, it is already present on pc but not on mobile. It will really help all the player if they are able to configure the buttons especially if they are the type of person that keeps their things organized and are convenient for them.\n","\n","368)This game is THE BEST story/adventure game EVER. The graphics is good, the story is good even the background music is FANTASTIC. The thing is, the story is not yet completed. Secondly, this game drains battery fast. Though I dont think theres anything for you to do. Overall, this game is entertaining, but if the first problem is fixed, it's a 5 star from me.\n","\n","369)this is a good game and it has good graphics and story is good since you get to experience so much in the world and collect a lot of different recorces for weapons and enhancements and levelling up. but hoyoverse if you read this then could u add to control type keyboard as a second option as some chromebooks dont have touch screen. so if you add this feature then it would help a lot of chromebook players who want to use keyboard instead of their trackpad. thanks for reading my review hoyoverse\n","\n","370)Been playing this game ever since its release and always looking forward for new regions. I definitely want to play till the end of this game. Graphics and designs are all gorgeous. Pulling for characters I wanted is what I love in this game, however, the genesis crystal purchase is too expensive. More than a hundred dollar in my currency but not even 1 pity (90 pulls). That's the only problem I have with the game so far. It makes me want to spend less honestly.\n","\n","371)It's amazing and all but my phone can't take that much storage and there are already many things that I have a problem with, especially visual bugs. Like the grass, ice (on bodies of water), and especially the damage taken not being seen. Overall, it's a great game, I love it sm but please do fix these visual bugs as it greatly affects the gameplay. Much love to HoYoVerse<3\n","\n","372)Its great! However when i test the game on tablets/mobile phones, it crashes. I know that phones and tablets arent the best for Genshin but whatever!Mostly, I have to clear the cache for it to stop crashing. Overall, great game and cool characters, Although i suggest u make more easier ways to get intertwined fate and more primogems, it could be a struggle for lower adventure rank players, a result of wanting their first five star, such as players under Adventure rank 30. Please make it easier\n","\n","373)Can't believe this is a mobile game. The gameplay is amazing. Minor tweaks required for story mode. Seems like there are a lot of things happening altogether. For a new player it can be a bit too much. Still, you can play hours after hours after hours. I hope the game improves steadily. Another request is for a better Asian server, ping is always higher than 200 even on fibernet.\n","\n","374)I have finally found a Free RPG that is worth playing!, I've dl so many that were either too complicated or the dialogue was too long. This is awesome!, I would love to be able to have a rideable familiar / pet to help on hunts and battles. Since there is so many elements like 🦁🐺🐉 I can't remember the other one, but it would be cool if you could achieve that as a familiar depending on the element. Please please please can you put that in 😖😣\n","\n","375)After almost 2 years,I had a great playing experience and like so much but now 🥲 Before this I have no trouble playing on my Android tablet which is kinda big since the gameplay is much simpler at the time. I do like more combo attack from different character, element reaction and mechanism is added but it makes playing using touchscreen become more difficult. I just wish that the developers could actually provide controller support instead of only touchscreen for Android device like iOS(ipad)\n","\n","376)As someone who has played since launch, it can start to get tedious the longer you play it, as dailies become a repeat of doing coms, spending resin and logging out. What really gets me staying is the story, lore and worldbuilding, which is absolutely amazing. The open world is stunning too. I think the wishing system overall is fine. The artifact system however definitely needs more work. The resin also should have a shorter regeneration rate and a way to store excess resin like in Honkai.\n","\n","377)sumeru's archon quest and lore are great! they're a time sink but they aren't rushed and explain a lot of important stuff. i hope that more plot-heavy stories can be permanent and not locked behind time-limited events. as for the exploration in sumeru, the entire region is fun to explore. it's interesting and new but not annoying like inazuma. the main thing i'd criticise are the character designs. many of the characters don't feel accurate to the cultures that they're inspired by.\n","\n","378)I am in love with palying genshin. It offers more than what you expect in a mobile game. It has stunning sceneries, dynamic visuals and soothing OSTs not to mention the smooth combat animation and art style and compelling storyline. Everything about genshin is awesome. But my request to hoyo is please fix RNG to get atleast decent artifacts.\n","\n","379)Been playing this game for a year. Graphics, soundtrack, characters, gameplay is excellent, and I love all of it. The only reason I couldn't give more than 3 stars , is due to the lack of end game content. Spiral abyss is the only end game content which refreshes 2 weeks after, and finished it in an hour . Then you're back to artifacts grinding, mats grinding which is capped by the resin limit. For small spender, you basically login for 30 mins, and you're done with everything you need to.\n","\n","380)It's the best and most addictive action rpg you could find and stick to, being a long term project. The gacha is fair more or less, the story and lore it's immersive and huge. The only reason I gave it less one star it's because the world quests that are not voicing the characters are full of lines of dialogues and rule of three. Also, considering this game is free, the master behind the soundtrack deserves no less of a mention, the music bringing the most terrific experience\n","\n","381)Its a great game, story is pretty well done and all... but over time it became a chore with the daily quests. Your also pretty limited on characters especially if the character you want happens to be a \"limited time banner\" and you dont get much of a choice its a gamble really. There is a pity system but that in itself is time consuming. Not to mentioning the size of the file it is... telling your friends about it sucks becuase they have too \"catch up\" to the current event...\n","\n","382)i LOVE this game very much but there are a few issues that affect the gameplay of mobile users.firstly, we cant see the ice in the game whenever we freeze water. secondly, the damage numbers. the number of damage done cannot be seen on a lot of mobile players' phone and without seeing the damage, players will not be able to improve their characters' builds. lastly, the grass effect in the game which is just a flat piece of land.i hope these problems are resolved soon to allow a better experience\n","\n","383)A TRIPLE-A GAME THATS FREE?? I was shocked when I heard that a year ago, and they were not wrong. Despite the fandom's tendency to be toxic, the game itself is very enjoyable and amazing with multuple stories, gameplay styles and mechanics! While I have only been playing since 2.8, it has so far been promising and I hope you keep it free (and fix the storage)\n","\n","384)Amazing story and great amount of effort put into graphics, lore, music, fighting and puzzle mechanics. It's well optimized and loads fast on phone. I removed a star hopefully temporarily. Latest update is breathtaking, inspired by India/Arabia. Most characters have a very light skintone despite foreign names. It's very disturbing, changing a colour on a model is easy. I implore you to re-chose appropriate skintones, even for playable characters (eg. kusanali). It comes across as discriminatory.\n","\n","385)I honestly love this! But the sumeru dessert isn't what you really promised to the mobile users.You did say the sumeru dessert will be realistic but it seems only for the PC's. Because the dessert has the same quality to all the maps. Not realistic ,lags(happens sometimes while fighting, randomly) and i do recommend something! You know when like your AR increase and you have to do a domain? I recommend that when done. The enemies level increase when the characters level are suitable.\n","\n","386)It is a very good game for people who don't really have a proper experience playing games. It is a great introduction to game themes and mechanics. It is so a very casual game that is more towards people who wanna tackle some day to day few minutes or boredom while providing beautiful scenery and music.\n","\n","387)(Edited) The difficulty ratio when leveling up to a new world level seems heavily unbalanced. I've been playing this game since it debuted, and I keep hitting a plateau. It's frustrating when this game has beautiful graphics and a wonderful storyline. The newest updates have kept gameplay engaging with new areas unlocking in succession.\n","\n","388)My new review, The game is honestly amazing I really like it I wish there was more diversity with skin tones such a darker tones! But after that the game is really nice and the map is just amazing all the places you can go to and the characters desings are amazing but I do think it hard to get new character or 5 star characters which ik is the point of the game but still- I wish there was a bigger chance to win a 50/50 LMAO Overall I would definitely get this app <33\n","\n","389)Actually the game is amazing but If you add sandbox mode or what ever It called. There would the players have an unlimited primogams and have unlimited wishes just like all players wants but it wouldn't have quest so the player would get back to the original server. This would make less hacking and the game would have an amazing reviews. That's all. Thanks🙏?(edit) thank you very much for the gift mails it really helps the players to get to more wishes for new characters.\n","\n","390)Y'know what I like about this game the most? THE OST ARE AMAZING!!! However, I experienced some lags after new region releases, happened during Inazuma release and now Sumeru. The lags will stop once the region has been released for a while or if there's a new region being released. Over all it's still a fun game. M happy with the decision of the developer to shorten the each version time bc it makes the game feels more compact in terms of content.\n","\n","391)Hello! If youre looking for a fun game to kill time (and you have to have a lot of time and space in your device), this is a right choice fr. The graphics are awesome (not the best, but still beautiful), lore is awesome and theres so much you wont ever be bored, the characters are nice, but you gotta know theres no actually black character (yet?) mostly tanned and white, the game really should get this better.... other than that, i am in love with this game, be careful not to play too much tho.\n","\n","392)The game is amazing. Best quality and open world. Everything perfect like it's on PC. The only problem many are facing is with the storage. It's nearly 20gb. So i guess if you can, you should compress it\n","\n","393)The game is very good but the developer need to optimize the cut scene. I set the graphic for my phone mid bcs my phone cannot handle higher graphic. But when cut scene appear in story (cut scene is at very high graphic, not same with game graphic setting), my phone stuck and i need to relogin back into game. When i manage to relogin, the cut scene alredy finish n i need to watch back the cut scene at youtube. Sadge🥲\n","\n","394)There are many pros and cons to genshin impact. Pros: open world, play at your own pace, and events. Cons: the primogems are difficult unless you pay money, and the people who pay get an upper advantage, and are more likely to get new characters. Thankfully, it is possible to beat the game with only the starter characters. Sadly, everything, I mean RVERYTHING is a gamble.\n","\n","395)4 stars, the character designs and story are very creative and nice, but there is just one bug that other players experience. I have 47 GB left but i do not see any grass, dmg, or ice. Please fix it soon.\n","\n","396)I see a lot of potential in this game. It looks amazing on PC and runs really well on a good computer with decent storage space but getting your hands on a phone that can run genshin impact without having any performance issues can be quiet expensive, not to mention it is quiet taxing on the storage space, if you don't have enough storage to download this game big RIP.\n","\n","397)Very amazing. For a mobile game this this pack a lot of things. Truly amazing. But i put 4 star because 1. Swapping character during combat is unintuitive due to the fact that only three slot were shown. This make the order jumbled 2. The lip sync won't be soo hard to be fixed. Considering the amount of revenue this game have. I won't be surprised if a whole software were develop to make the lip sync with each different languages Other than that this game is amazin\n","\n","398)They added a new region and some strange quality of life upgrades. Sumeru gives players a lit more things to do and that aranyaka quest takes hours to complete, but it doesn't solve the overall underlying issue that genshin still doesn't have an endgame, or difficult content. Changes in the wish, resin or artifacts randomizer systems would have been preferred instead of the wood collector thingy. Contrarily, dendro is an awesome element, and seeing new game mechanics is absolutely phenomenal.\n","\n","399)This game is my who life! Although If you are a mobile player like me it's not the best experience because of how much storage it takes up and how laggy it can get at times. I do recommend playing on a PC if you don't wanna be so laggy but at the same time ive never played on apc so idk if that's good either.\n","\n","400)Overall, it's a great experience. Enjoyed the game for a while till it gets a bit repetitive. The game has a really huge map to explore (including time-limited maps) with beautiful landscapes. The music and character designs are amazing! The resin system and the gacha rates are pretty underwhelming.. and yeah, thats all..\n","\n","401)Ok\n","\n","402)The game is fairly good, in all honesty. However, an increase in ways to obtain Primogems would be appreciated, and adding limited characters should be added to the shop, instead of those on standard. Not everyone can wish on the banners they want, and I see that as a bit of an issue.\n","\n","403)Nice but take it easy\n","\n","404)It's a great game but there's a glich that whenever I exit the app it, I need to download 18k mb because it restarts every time. And it takes a huge amount of time.\n","\n","405)Game is good but there is buffering in cutscense\n","\n","406)Best experience. But this application is not update\n","\n","407)This game is awesome but the loading takes forever I love the way the characters have there own unique skin.\n","\n","408)Great game , with outstanding graphics and game style , but new character cyno becomes worse than keqing unless you have good dendro applier.and can u please bring dendro swirl reaction....and can u bring an event to win free 5 star weapon, because weapon banner system sucks🤮🤮🤮\n","\n","409)The game is just awesome but the recent update of 3.1 in which sumeru desert was released,The desert region is very laggy .Can you fix it.\n","\n","410)Amazing Game! I love the characters and the action.\n","\n","411)I honestly really love this game but the only thing I have with it is at the beginning where it takes about 20 minutes to load for an update but it's worth it because once you load into the game it's really high, detailed and super fun\n","\n","412)It's a good game. Battery drainer though but that is to be expected\n","\n","413)I've been playing since launch now- so please for the LOVE OF GOD lower the pity, that's literally all I want and need. Lower the pity to 60 or something, thank you.\n","\n","414)Game Is good graphics are best story line and all other things is awesome, just one thing not good that is also take to much time to load , prepare and check the data its realy take '5' minutes to start, low internet is realy not the issue heare, if possible please fix this issue of mine.\n","\n","415)it's good. I recommend installing it, very relaxing. The only problem I have with the game is that it takes up too much stoage/space on my tablet. So for those of you who want to install this it might take up too much space. 4/5\n","\n","416)I love genshin it's really cool and all. Biggest problem is the lags on mobile but overall the graphics are gorgeous, the characters are nice and the story is really interesting! Sumeru really is a really interesting nation and the lore is sooo good. Can't wait for the Scaramouche boos fight haha :)\n","\n","417)This is literally so fun I ould play it all day every day if I could the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is bc the lack of instructions it doesn't really tell you how to unlock new characters or anything like that so it could be confusing for new players but other then that I definitely recommend\n","\n","418)Nice graphic and gameplay. Hats off to the developer\n","\n","419)Absolutely amazing, runs great on my phone and the storyline is really engaging. However, it takes a ridiculous amount of storage, so if you dont have storage to spare, I wouldn't reccomend. If you do, however, the controls and gameplay mechanics are easy enough to get the hang of and I would highly reccomend playing it. I no longer have enough storage left to play it on my phone or laptop, but it was great while it lasted.\n","\n","420)Nice\n","\n","421)Wifi 150mbps why high ping 200-500ms report\n","\n","422)Its very good and I am glad that I found this game\n","\n","423)Overall the game is good and the story quests are fun and interesting but the game is starting to get weird. Most of the time I can't see my opponent's HP after I use some of my characters burst when I'm fighting which is very frustrating (this never happens when I'm in PC but I use my CP most of the time...) sometimes I just don't use their burst anymore when fighting because I can't see my opponent's HP..I also can't see the ice when I'm ice bridging..\n","\n","424)It is fun but I didn't get 20 free rolls That is why I give you four star\n","\n","425)Great game but i just have 1 problem, sometimes the health bars disappears and i have to exit and open the app again to make the healthbars appear again.\n","\n","426)I can't even play the game. I was hoping that the data would not be large but then I got in and it wanted to take up over 14 GB like the freak. Ok I know the world is large and the game is good but I can't even play it. Yeah sorry\n","\n","427)Nice 😊😊\n","\n","428)this rpg game is so good\n","\n","429)It's an anime rpg gacha game with huge maps and vast amount of stories!

But I would like Hoyoverse to give free wishes as in tower of fantasy I would be very grateful to you!! Thank you ❤️\n","\n","431)Pretty nice\n","\n","432)at first this was fun, but then when you reach AR 45+ you’ll get bored. just doing daily commission, using the resin, and waiting for the next event/update. it’s the same all day\n","\n","433)This game is all good, but do you accept request for new characters? As for me I have a suggestion, Why don't you add Mika, Nilou, Nahida, Dehya and Dainself as a playable character?\n","\n","434)Good game\n","\n","435)nice game overall. and the 2nd anniversary rewards are somewhat impressive, keep it better next year. 3-4 stars because i wanna express my depression due to my awful gacha experience, always lost 50/50 at hardest pity.\n","\n","436)Perhaps it'll get better.\n","\n","437)Wow\n","\n","438)Nice game\n","\n","439)It's good, but I have a complaint. I was doing the \"Of Ballads of Brews\", and then it said that I had gotten timed out/disconnected. When I logged back in, my progress got refreshed, and I was at AR 5. All my characters gone! So was my primogems, and other items. I really hope Hoyoverse can help me out with this problem, I worked hard to get those characters and AR 23.\n","\n","440)It's an awesome game but the only issues are it constantly requires a good internet connection and lots of space on your mobile\n","\n","441)A really fun game I recommend characters are cute and a fun storyline and you can play with friends and gamble,but the reason i rate it a 4 is beacuse the characters are getting weaker aside from that I recommend it\n","\n","442)My love-hate relationship with this game has been going on for nearly two years now. The visuals are always stunning, and the story and characters are top quality. The gacha and resin systems are still abysmal, but I've slowly been able to build up a decent team despite this. For that reason, the game is good in my eyes.\n","\n","443)good content for sumeru.\n","\n","444)Edit: Pretty good for a free game all in all I had fun exploring the map,character designs,music and animations are also good. The story/overall plot needs work though.(inazuma archon quest had bad writing)\n","\n","445)a really good game, I recommend it! but I took away a star because of how laggy it is. no matter how low I put my graphics, its still extremely laggy. over all it is not a bad game. I highly recommend it!\n","\n","446)The new sumeru region is good. I like the desert region. Archon quest is good atm. but the overall story is too slow paced and all new character designs are just aweful.\n","\n","447)The game is actually very good.Story quest,event, character designing,lore and game style is very beautiful but the only bad is the artifact grining and the resin cap like yes say we got a strong box but the drop rate of good Artifact is low. Atleast i wish the resin cap and drop rate of good artifact in the future updates they make it good for everyone.\n","\n","448)2 years of my life. It's great. Please add more brown.\n","\n","449)It's a great game for mobile and for PC. The graphics, story/plot/lore, character and design are really great.\n","\n","450)This is an extremely expansive and detailed open world game. It's very similar to Breath of the Wild in many of it's game mechanics, from climbing to collecting plants to teleporting to fighting monsters. It has an excellent, detailed story and lots of characters. And for so much content, it's almost ridiculous it's completely free to play it all! And unlike other \"free-to-play\" games, most of the in-game purchases can be achieved just by working hard in the game rather than spending cash.\n","\n","451)I kinda got into it a couple years ago, but I had bad wifi and phone service, so I stopped playing because it didn't play well. I started playing again and I'm hooked. The characters have a wide range of differences, the story has been executed so well so far, the OST is stunning. Sure, there are some bugs, but with the frequent enough updates, they're usually resolved pretty quickly.\n","\n","452)The graphics are amazing and it's a good and simple game to play. It's not to hard to understand and not too easy to understand sometimes but later in game you'll understand what they mean. Also, I love the character development and outfits. I'll rate this a five because this is indeed a very nice and well developed game. Lastly, Happy 2nd Anniversary! ?,5,0,3.1.0_10443587_10457664,2022-10-02 02:47:32,,,most_relevant,com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact\n","4b543f6d-d96b-47b5-8b78-808a31d3f050,Anzio,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu_BtCEIzU7hJrWK_KGnWGXos0TPzQerhytQ7JUi,Genshin impact is one of my favorite games. Overall  there's so much to do! The storyline is simply amazing and it really pulled me in when I started. From building characters to exploring the world  the possibilities are pretty ranged. And the co-op system is very cool. I've met a lot of people throughout the year of playing  and I'm extremely satisfied. You'll need to put in a lot of time and effort to progress since the quests (EX; Archon quests\n","\n","453)The best mobile game I have ever played, and I've played around 400+ over the years. In terms of replayability, daily drops, animation, combat, characters, Genshin is totally unmatched by anything else. I also wanted to say that the weight of the characters feels good. Jumps, attacks, flying, it l feels natural. Really good stuff, I will continue to drop many hours and dollars for the privilege of playing.\n","\n","454)Love the game. I only have a few issues with it such as the loading time, but hey. The graphics, game play, story, and music more than make up for it. It does take a tedious amount of time to raise my Adventure Rank, so maybe some more ways to earn Adventure EXP would help. My only other problem is elemental reactions are hard to remember lol. Overall it's a great game. I love it so much! And by the way, Kaeya is the best character and nobody can change my mind. Cryo forever ❄️!\n","\n","455)Best game ever, on any platform. I've played for more than 2 years now, and I'm always captivated by the artwork, and music. It is stunning!! The consistent upgrades are always great, and show that developers are very interested in progressing this game. Never boring, always beautiful. The only thing I would suggest is to offer the option of personalizing the traveler character, so we can make them as diverse as we are. Truly remarkable game.\n","\n","456)Most games that have multiple platforms do not perform well when switching to a mobile device. I'm beyond impressed with this mobile version. While I still enjoy the control/accuracy I get playing on my PC more, if I'm away from home this is an awesome alternative. Especially given the fact that it's free with no ads.\n","\n","457)This is probably the best android game I've played. The graphics are outstanding for a mobile platform game! Of course you are ab,e to get it on PC and on PC it's more detailed... but overall the graphics on mobile are still phenomenal! I truly recommend this game because it's not boring! There are so many things to do, the story line is fascinating, and it's a level up fighting game! In the end I love this game\n","\n","458)Almost 2 years of scattered play. I always return for new content. The stories are fun and the game play is too. Some of my friends started playing recently and they like it but it's a lot to get through as far as reputation. I think Mihoyo may need to come up with a faster route to get new players caught up with older players - so old and new players can play \"fairly\" what I mean is, I don't want to lower my world level and lose rewards, or wait for my friends to get stronger for a few months.\n","\n","459)I absolutely love and adore this game. By far my favorite story roleplaying game out there. The quests, lore, plots, mysteries, grind, pulls, all of it. I'm a newer player, but I haven't been bored yet of this game. I don't think I ever will. I'd say it's biggest issues is lagging, and setting it's quality different on its own. As well as occasional bugs on my laptop. If the frame per second(fps) could be a bit quicker that would be great. But other than that, the game is beautiful. Will update.\n","\n","460)Really awesome game, I play it almost everyday. The graphics, story, character designs, mechanics, the overall contents of the game are impeccable. The only problem is it tends to crash on my device whenever I enter multiplayer, especially during domains. Other than that, this is one of the best games I have ever played and you'll get addicted faster than James Charles's career flopped.\n","\n","461)The game in general is the best I've ever played in terms of adventure, fighting, scenery, events, etc. The only thing I'd like to be changed is the space it takes to run. If we are unable to replay story quests and scenes, it should be reasonable to have an option to delete those extra unused files to have more space. Other than that, best game out there.\n","\n","462)Honestly, Genshin is everything I'm looking for in a game. A fantasy setting, open world exploration and representation of real cultures, characters, beautiful art and graphics, cool outfits and weapons, co-op, quests, events, and music! The developers have worked and are continuing to work really hard on satisfying players with constant updates. In my opinion, you don't need to pay to make the experience fun. It's amazing no matter what. :)\n","\n","463)Update: 2.8 to 3.0 Genshin couldn't be better of a Game! Though i do wish there were more viable DPS characters instead of the support types we've been getting as of late. I love the game. No problems. Great storyline. Amazing art. I'd love to learn from the artists. VERY HAPPY WITH GENSHIN.! OLD: Keeps crashing after 2.5 update won't even get to the loading screen. Have plenty of available ram and storage space. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling twice\n","\n","464)Amazing. I would like it if any time I minimized the game it didn't have to re-connect and that you could unlock constellations instead of wishing. The main plot progresses slowwww and a lot of the quests are VERY monotonous and childish. Other than that it's a good game . I've spent a few real dollars playing and don't regret it.\n","\n","465)I love this game. Even though sometimes, I go on a break from it, I still will always love it. The characters are interesting + strong, you have artifacts, very good plot development, and many many more reasons why I love this game. Even if there's a few to many bugs, I'd still play it to let the devs know about these bugs. The areas are also fun to explore, as well. Some people managed to get extremely strong characters that are underrated!\n","\n","466)Hey, great game, first off! But I'm experiencing a bug recently the camera, not one of the \"Kameras.\" Zoom seems to be inverted. Zooming \"in\" ( + ) is zooming out, and zooming \"out\" ( - ) is in. I looked in game settings but didn't see any settings that would invert the in-game screengrab function... so help its mildly annoying but when you're wanting a nice shot especially in the event and it zooms \"out\" when you're wanting in its irritating. Thank you for a great and enjoyable game!\n","\n","467)I've played more than my fair share of gacha games. Genshin Impact has improved on all of them with an open world that's interesting to explore. Additionally, they've managed to avoid both the unnecessary powercreep usually seen in the genre, as well as keeping the systems simple to understand and play, while still rewarding mastery with fun gameplay. Overall, it's well worth getting into.\n","\n","468)It's great, I get lost in the battles and exploring new places on the map. Almost like playing on a pc. Good job! Aside from the \"Massive!\" Download and space it took up on my phone. It's playability and fun adventures make up for it. The only issue I had so far was my phone warming up. To fix the issue, I just (lowered the refresh rate). It was set too high over clocking my phones prosessors! Since then I've had no issues. GREAT GAME WORTH IT!! thanks for your time Sincerely Me\n","\n","469)This game is awesome if you have the right mindsets... for example if you like exploring and dynamic combat with elemental aspects while listening to well composed thematic music, you'll like this. It's cross platform, all data saved to the cloud. Seamless transition from ps4 to mobile... But if you want to collect every character... or speed run... you're going to need either patience and luck, or money. That said it is very approachable as free to play. If you like it, consider supporting.\n","\n","470)Amazing map, characters, banners, events, bosses, and overall, deserves 5 stars. I love the graphics, story, domains. It does take a REALLY long time to load when you first download, takes up space, but that doesn't matter compared to the story and lore. Great game. I love the banners, although I've heard the older characters, like Klee, don't get reruns often. I got early pity on both Xiao and standard banner. Great characters, I fell in love on like, the first day playing it. Thanks HoyoLab!\n","\n","471)Highest grade game I've ever played in my life. But it would be nice if you could turn particles and some other things off. I play on Nokia 5.4 with lower than lowest preset quality graphics and my game still freezes sometimes. Ive given up on grinding properly because domains take way too long to load into and out of. But it's still a great game so I recommend it to those with more than 4GB RAM\n","\n","472)I have played this game everyday since release and I don't plan on stopping today! For real I need help I have a problem. 10/10 ign. Actual review: the game is great! Awesome world to explore, good story, good characters, puzzles, loot, etc. It's what I'd call a AAA gotcha game. But you can play this game without spending a dollar if you don't want to. There is constant events and new character releases. I highly recommend it. The only bad side is the community tends to ruin the game.\n","\n","473)Amazing Music & Graphics! 😍 I've been playing off/on since the start & while I don't have all the characters or their constellations I still have a lot of fun playing. The free events rewards & the web daily login rewards are helpful. The map from their Tools helps a lot. I love that you can solo it all or you can choose multi. I play this on the PC with a numbered gaming mouse so I'm glad I can change keybinds. If you can, try both Mobile & PC versions to see which is best for you.\n","\n","474)Some details about weaponry, gaining objects, are constant obstacles. But the reason I give this game 5 stars, is because the scenery, dialog(Voice-acting), plot, and wide range of challenges. Everything in the game levels up as well as you. The challenges are never ending, and along with it, never ending fun. This is like being the character your playing as. I get attatchedto the characters and almost feel what they do. It's very engaging! 5 stars(again) you should INSTALL NOW!\n","\n","475)Probably the best free gaming experience I've ever played, at least on Android, and the ability to play across other platforms is great too! But honestly I have had the easiest time pulling for good characters and equipment in this game than any other game, and I actually like the characters! Fully voiced and with their own unique abilities!\n","\n","476)Played since launch, max adventure rank. This is one of the greatest multi-platform game one can ask for. It may be a gacha game, but it certainly doesn't feel like one. The combat, playstyle, story, music, and visuals are absolutely top tier! You'd be missing out by not trying it and enjoying what a masterpiece of a game this is. What's even better you can play on any platform with cross saves across all, to play wherever and on whatever with same account as you wish. 10/10\n","\n","477)I LOVE IT! The characters, the scenery, the updates, ect. It's such a fun game and its pretty realistic in certain ways. Like the creator of genshin deserves a noble peice price. The only thing is how you have to buy outfits and other stuff, but it's the best game I have ever played and I'm looking for more updates and banners.\n","\n","478)One of the best free to play games period. It's not play to win. But if you want to get some of the really cool characters you might need to spend a bit of money. You can still get a chance to get the 5 star characters without it just takes a great deal of time and grinding and even then it's not always guaranteed. But overall absolutely amazing. They are always updating with new materials. Quests lines and boss battles. Epic is an understatement!\n","\n","479)Simply put: I love the game. The world, characters, artstyle, combat, and music will suck you in. You don't need to spend any money to get cool characters, feel powerful and clear all the content. And there are a couple great options for light spenders so no need to whale. My only wish is for more permanent combat focused endgame. But try it out, I promise you'll have fun.\n","\n","480)This game is absolutely AMAZING, you should totally get it. The only problem for me is that I can't get the quest Undetected Infiltration. I've done everything. I've logged out, I even uninstalled the app and installed it again and that still didn't work. I had someone else do it for me which that didn't work either. Another thing is I can't see the health on hillichurls and stuff. Another than that this game is rlly fun! (I would rlly love to get this problem fixed tho ty)\n","\n","481)Let me first start off by saying that this game IS INCREDIBLE!! This game is NOT p2w(pay to win), it's f2p(free to play) 100%! The graphics, INCREDIBLE! The music, INCREDIBLE! The stories, INCREDIBLE! The cutscenes, INCREDIBLE! If you ever played Chrono Cross or Final Fantasy for the consoles, then this is the GAME FOR YOU! The file is big, 20GB but, it's worth it IMO! You'll need a powerful phone to play this, although you can change graphics to low, that takes away the exp. HAVE FUN!! 🙏❤️🙏\n","\n","482)I'm going to be 100% honest. Genshin Impact is the most addicting game ever, better than minecraft actually. I love the game design and I think the idea kf u locking new regions with different elements in them is truly fascinating. The graphic designs are beautiful and I love how every dcharacter has a unique design that originates from their homeland. The plot of the entire game is also amazing and has a great lead on the stories. Overall, best game ever!\n","\n","483)It's the most amazing game I have ever played The storyline,the characters,the designs,the quality, the art and everything thing about it is awesome the only issue is the storage. Alot of people want to play the game but they don't storage on their phone and there are some devices that has low RAM But everything about the game is awesome. Thanks you for making this game for us we really appreciate it ^^\n","\n","484)The game is quite easy to play (I mean the controls) the graphics is good, music is amazing and voice actors did their job very well. Wishing and resin domain system isnt really what most people would expect, but I think that the fact that primos and good artefacts are hard to get makes the game way more interesting. Personally I really would like just a bit better rewards when you get to 56+ ar and rewards when you get 100% exploration progress\n","\n","485)I love this game the art style is amazing as well as the story, you don't just have one thing to do the curators had made it that there are other stories to go along with and you get rewards for finishing. They have interesting puzzles to slovenly which gets you to use your brain. The fights are amazing especially when you have to level up and they enemies get stronger just like you. An intelligent thing they added was if things get to difficult you can down grade your world adventure level\n","\n","486)Thoroughly enjoying the storyline and game play which is rare for me. The storyline are well planned and are quite interesting to watch and participate in. The cut-scenes are very well made and beautiful and I would love to see them again if the chance arose. The game play is both challenging yet relaxed depending on what you are doing. I love the fact that you can gather materials, explore, collect items (and weapons), decorate your own serenitea pot, play with friends and complete puzzles.\n","\n","487)It's the best Roll-game that I ever seen. the graphic is really awesome.I mean, even the small details are taken into consideration. the story line is really enjoyable. there is lot to do in the game , cooking, farming, solving puzzles , searching , fighting and more !!Actually I addicted to it !! Try it, I promise you you fall in love with it !!!\n","\n","488)I love this game! Lore, characters, graphics and gameplay are absolutely stunning, there's a lot to do and explore and there are new updates very often! There are obviously some meh things like artifacts farming or the pulling thing or the mobile graphics but they are not a big problem. It's a free game and it's super fun to play! Tho I recommend the PC version because it's pretty hard to play on mobile.\n","\n","489)Character cool design and animation with different cool kit. Cool elemental reaction (which is my main reason playing this game). Gacha system kind of hard, but you can get into softpity easily if you aim only for the character. Overall character balance, never too broken or never too bad (which is very good). Best music experience. Story wise kind of meeh, but I think gamecreator already do their best to coordinate with their team. Event gameplay has been improving which become better. Good job\n","\n","490)I'm a mobile player and, although at times it can be a bit laggy, overall the graphics and contrast are easy to use and sufficient. The game itself is extremely fun and engaging, I've played for over 14 hrs in one week! Played as a story/lore game and a RPG, and not to forget the intricate but well thought out character kits and how to maximise stats etc. All the best luck to those wishing and gaming!\n","\n","491)Keeps you playing for hours and the events are versatile and fun. You can see that the developers put their everything into it, from music to characters to the design of the areas. Although the story pace is a bit lacking but to each their own. Edit: The sumeru update is a huuuge step up from previous patches. The area is amazing and I don't even feel like sprinting, but just walking around, looking at the scenery. The archon story is PERFECT. Haven't felt so immersed in a while.\n","\n","492)It is nice and beautiful game, and through the years of developing it, I can say that it improved a lot. Though there are some bugs and issues that is needed to be fixed as soon as possible especially the issue in downloading and updating. A lot of users experiencing it especially in PC when downloading or updating the game, there are a lot of error before you can even downloaded it 100%. I hope these issues will be fixed soon. Anyway, it is a definitely a successful game after all.\n","\n","493)I don't think I have to explain why this game is so incredibly beautiful. The graphics, the storyline, the characters are all very unique and wonderful! Although I'm encountering a problem, the quest \"Chasm spelunkers\" seems to have disappeared from the menu, even though I remember doing the first half of it, but suddenly it made me \"Go to the designated location to investigate\" and I can't do it! I have to complete the \"Chasm spelunkers\" but again as I said it disappeared! Please help\n","\n","494)One of my favourite games. I can easily say that I'll be sticking with it till the last update and beyond. The controls and features are quick to learn, making this a great game for new players. The character design and open world are some of my favourite things, it's difficult to run out of things to do in genshin. One thing I'd like to see more of in the future is characters with diverse body types and skin tones, it would be nice to see a diverse range of characters.\n","\n","495)Its a really amazing app! It has good graphics, amazing character design, interesting story line, well made cut scenes and etc! but there is a problem sometimes my game lags and freezes in one scene when in pc sometimes please fix this problem, and updating it causes more space the longer you play, but other than that it has no other problem so good job! (Also happy 2nd anniversary genshin🥳🥳🥳)\n","\n","496)It's amazing! But Whenever Dvalin appears the screen becomes glitchy, so I can't see or aim, Could you please fix it? If I can't defeat the boss I can't advance in the story. Theres also another weird glitch where when a water surface is frozen, I can't see the ice, But others can. Edit: Thanks so much the glitches have been fixed!\n","\n","497)The storyline is just amazing. This is quite one of the best games I ever played in a while, the characters have a amazing design with a amazing backstory. The map is big with everything to explore! The bosses have a great design and an amazing attacks! Overall this is a amazing game. recommended! Edit: hoyoverse if you see this, there's a problem when I join the game. It kicks me out everytime I need to join the game, please fix it if possible.\n","\n","498)I've only started playing on late 2.5 update bcos I didn't have anybcompatible device with this game, but I've seen my friends and streamers play this. In March this year I finally had the chance to play it myself. I might be exaggerating for some, but in this generation of open world games, this is one of the best and the best. The mechanics, the combat, the puzzles, the graphics, character designs, and ESPECIALLY THE STORY are just top notch. Can't wait to see more!\n","\n","499)I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. The exploration is really fun, the story is gripping, the gameplay is fluid, the art style and graphics are also amazing (even on mobile). Though grinding for materials may get dull after a while it is still fun, in its own way, to do domains every day for talent books, artifacts, weapon ascension materials when your resin refils. Overall its a really fun experience and i would recommend trying it out to anyone who may be interested.\n","\n","500)I love genhsin impact:) It's an awesome game, only problem is that it continuously glitches and way too much. Like for examamples, I could be fighting a boss, and it'll glitch mid fight and I'd loose health. Or i could be watching one of the uninteractive scenes and I wouldn't be able to see it and the voices would also glitch. But overrall, I absolutely LOVE this game. It's probably the best vidiogame I've played in awhile.\n","\n","501)After entering Sumeru (Version 3.0 update), it feels like the game is more amazing. So many new contents: Archon quests, chain of many world quests, new events, new area to explore (Sumeru). I think it will take a lot of my time to clear all of those. The new map (Sumeru area) is so complex. Not to mention the new Dendro element. New characters to develop, too.\n","\n","502)The game itself is extremely well done and super enjoyable, I've been playing for a year and a half and I'm still not tired of it but be sure to have a good phone if you plan to play it on mobile. Otherwise play it on PC or PS, it's free there too ^^ p.s: Also, make sure to know what self-restraint is otherwise a gambling addiction might be on the way.\n","\n","503)Great graphics and the character designs are also great , even the story line is excellently written in my opinion. However I do think that it takes a bit too long to download all the necessary data, I understand it's necessary to make the game look as good as it is but if you play genshin on your mobile device like me then you know the downloading can be a little long.\n","\n","504)Even though I only play this game for a year, the game is very amazing, the quality the story, etc. I like hearing different stories about different characters, going to quest and explore different nations I found this game interesting because of the archon quest, and character combat and events , well sometimes you get bored and just have a break for a while. Very amazing the developer did a great job!\n","\n","505)It is mind blowing just how much there is to do in this game. It is easily one of my favourites. If not one of the best games on mobile rn. I'm playing this on the S22 Ultra and it runs incredibly smooth even with everything turned up. It can eat up abit of battery during longer play sessions and it uses very little data to play. All in all a phenomenal game that gets alot of love and support by developers.\n","\n","506)One of the best games with amazing graphics and one that the advertisement and promotional videos are actually how it looks like in the game. The laggyness some players experience is due to either their own phone or WiFi. I had the same problem with disconnecting with my old phone but got a new one and the graphics are absolutely amazing.\n","\n","507)After the patch 2.8 update the chat seems to be broken, it doesn't show any conversations from my friends and even if I send a new message, it turns into blank again after exiting the chat section or switching to another friends convo. My friend also experienced this after the update. This bug needs to be fixed asap, i can't even knoe what my friend is trying to say in the chat. Edit: already fixed\n","\n","508)One of my favourite games of the last 5 years. If you can navigate the predatory nature of gachas, there is a beautifully well crafted game here with plenty of exploration, deep story and lore, and some amazing characters. Content is constantly updated at a good pace, and offers quite a bit of variety. The game has only got better with time.\n","\n","509)Genshin has amazing graphics when set on high. The storyline is interesting and wishing can be exciting and disappointing. Gameplay is amazing and I recommend anyone to download. Only problem is with every new update the game takes anywhere from 2-10GB each update. That's the only thing that can be optimised.\n","\n","510)Top of the line graphics and gameplay and if you study east Asian languages this game is perfect for you because it's fully translated AND VOICED in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. My main complaints are its high battery use, device temperature and battery drain. Also it's an always online game even when you're on single player so you can't play it without a connection. It's incredibly addictive, but not very time consuming unless you want to do more.\n","\n","511)This game is really good! It's fun due to its graphics, characters, designs, puzzles and more!, It's fun doing the archon quests and exploring new things, getting characters and more! But I do wish that in 3.1 that they will add a button in the settings to make paimon follow you, (sorry if it's too much to ask, I just love this idea)\n","\n","512)It was definitely an awesome experience! I really liked how the scenery were. It's so beautiful and mesmerizing! Specially Liyue I really liked it there and the architecture. What culture is that? Was it from China? I have yet to explore the world of Teyvat but I am taking my time. I thank that person for introducing this game to me. Overall it was definitely amazing and awesome!! I'm really looking forward for the other Archon aswell as their city and also the new characters.\n","\n","513)This game is amazing. The level of care put into it will take your breath away more than once. The landscapes, the music (don't get me started on the music), the characters, the fights are close to perfection. The map is huge. Sumeru is amazing. This level of detail is not even found in all pc games. You should play this game.\n","\n","514)Graphic,Music,Ost,Gameplay,Map,character design and especially the lore is excellent. It's a good game to relieve stress(unless you're a meta player). But the game is not optimized yet for most device (especially android). After each update,It's lagging. I hope they'll fix that in the future.\n","\n","515)From the perspective of a low-end smartphone gaming, 4gb RAM is enough to experience the whole Mondstadt region (1st Chapter quest) in the lowest specs possible. Then further down, you might experience increasing stutters and lags as Liyue, Inazuma, and Sumery fills in the limit of the RAM. I just reset everytime I went to another region to reduce the said issues. But it's a whole new experience for a newbie like me in the open world of 3PRPG .\n","\n","516)This game is the best RPG game I have ever played in my life! I like how interactive it is as you explore the surroundings. The environments of the game were so beautiful it blew me away! There is one problem though, and that's the download. It takes very long to download the sources, and can take up to a day. And it also consumes A LOT of GB. Maybe a little rigged but other than that it's great for all ages. Edit: Recent updates made game better so I'm giving a 5 now\n","\n","517)This is a very nice game with beautiful scenery and fights. The only problem is with the size of the game. Now it is taking 20 gb of my phone space. Well for that level of graphics it may need that much space but I would be happy if I can delete unwanted things like voice lines and other things from my space to reduce the burden on my phone. Otherwise my phone may die by next year.\n","\n","518)I've been playing the game in 2.0 (which means I've been playing for a year), nothing really bothers me, but it all started when 2.7, I got very late with story quests since I'm not that strong to defeat the enemies, I'm also not a meta builder, overall, aside from all that, it's a good game.\n","\n","519)I love this game! The environment and it's soundtrack is just beautiful and immersive. The combat is very fresh and fun. It's very F2P friendly! There's no PvP and as long as you manage and plan your gems wisely, you will obtain characters you want :D (notice I didn't say \"need\") All of the characters are enjoyable, I personally love the Fatui Harbingers ?and they're one of the main antagonists! One nitpick though: I'd like to see much more unique characters, both design and gameplay-wise :)\n","\n","520)It's really fun, you can play with your friends and explore, there's also a lot of fun events and it gives a lot of primogems, i am also excited about the new sumeru update. But sadly I can't see ice, damage, grass and elemental reactions. I hope you can fix this bug because a lot of players also experience this.\n","\n","521)It is a very fun, exciting game that honestly has so many different regions and different addicting gameplays with a gacha system. Despite the lackluster rewards, the overall quality and environment, music, is absolute stunning. Its a fun, addicting and nice game and I would recommend to play during anniversary periods if you are addicted with rewards (like me)\n","\n","522)The story is exquisite. It is incredible, and the action is just right. The music is not only tailored to fit the regions, but I'm amazed by how beautiful they all sound. All details including the finer details when you look closer at them can really be worth exploring. Truly an experience worth the storage and worth spending money on despite it being a free game. Well done in creating such and excellent story game.\n","\n","523)I have no words to describe this game. Okay, maybe I have some. 1. Laggy. It's laggy, especially since Sumeru Release. 2. Awesome. Other than being laggy, it's still an awesome game. Great graphics IF YOUR PHONE/DEVICE CAN HANDLE IT. But other than those negative stuff, this game is still pretty good in its own way. Might get abit boring, but if your up to an adventure, seeing cool scenery, listening to great music, and grinding everyday, 10/10 recommend this game.\n","\n","524)Been playing this for over a month now, i really love it! If you have a hard time to find interesting games that you can actually play without getting bored of them i recommend you try it. I've been playing this on my phone and (mostly) on my pc. Its kinda boring at the start tbh but it gets better with each story quest!\n","\n","525)Honestly so far I really like it, but I just wish that there was a 𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 option. I feel like it would really get things to be a whole lot more interesting (not that it isn't interesting now) and it would also make everything feel cooley interactive, anyways it's just a suggestion because I know tons of fans would love to have that option and you can see how deprived some people are when these...ahem...ships.\n","\n","526)Look, I tend to get bored of games after a month or two. This game? We're past the year mark. Expansive world (that grows more expansive by the update), great mix of mechanics and possibilities for unique setups, and lovely voice actors who know what they're doing (except maybe Paimon - i liked Corina Boettger's voice better in her Sailor Moon days). 11 out of 10, would recommend.\n","\n","527)One of the best games you could ever play. Besides the incredible music, beautiful open world, interactions with richly developed NPCS and characters, the quality and strength of a character is based on your willingness to work on them. There are opportunities for strategy, planning, and just all fun.\n","\n","528)It's hard to belive there is such an android game that is open world filled with lots of places and many great stories. And each update they add even more which means the develpers care about players that might have reached the rock bottom. I was able to play the game free so far and no purchases is needed .have fun\n","\n","529)This game is amazing, I saw the news of if becoming an anime and how people talk it about it made me download it and darn it's so awesome, I really recommend it so enjoyable. the one problem is I saw many people have trouble with a quest the \"look for offering\" almost everyone can't find the cup after completing the mission no dude come and talk to give us the cup no matter where we try so I hope this get fix half of us are still stuck there.\n","\n","530)This game is so addicting i love it so much. Every since i started playing,its so hard to quit play genshin. It's so addicting because the graphics,video quality,sound quality etc. Is so good and high quality. The character designs are super detailed and stunning. The quests are super fun and enjoyable and i also love doing comms. I also really love the 2nd anniversary awards. This game is 11/10. I just kinda wish that it wouldn't be alot of gb. This game's super fun i TOTALLY recommend\n","\n","531)The best game ever that I've ever played. I love the storyline, and the graphic is fantastic! I regretted that i didn't find this game earlier, then seeing the past events that i couldn't join makes me feel sad, but hey! I'm quite satisfied with all the events that i have participated ever since. I hope that developers can make more interesting and fantastic events in the future. I'm very excited and looking forward for the next update 🤗\n","\n","532)This game is so amazing...just , wow . I really loved it, the characters, the lore, the only thing I would like to add is a free draw when the banner changes, at least one draw each time , but I still loved it even if you don't add it\n","\n","533)Addicting... fun and hours of gameplay... i play it on my laptop,ps5 and on my phone depending on my location... i love to spend money on it but its not ReQuired... I just wish some of the characters could be found in random places and give us random quests... i would also love for characters to interact with each other like if i play with zhongli and my coop partner play with venti they have minor interactions instead of relying on profile voices... love it tho\n","\n","534)Very Awesome, reminds me of Zelda - Breath of the Wild with the game play style. Almost 20 gigabyte download, but it's worth it. Excellent graphics and a lot of detail. A lot of detail went into this game, based on what I have played so far.\n","\n","535)Unistall genshin I very love I\n","\n","536)Wonderful Game\n","\n","537)Is a very good game you should play it\n","\n","538)It was amazing! I got a 5 star character! This is the best game ever!\n","\n","539)Love it, you can tell alot of love is put into this game.\n","\n","540)Good game. Character design is weird lol.\n","\n","541)I love how there is names like li ding and dang and tic tac toe\n","\n","542)Good game\n","\n","543)Good\n","\n","544)Exquisite\n","\n","545)Great\n","\n","546)Good.

I like the story,grafics,twist and everything.\n","\n","553)I just started playing the game a few days ago since my phone can't handle the game cause of its very big gb needed and now i bought a new phone and play it and it was awesome the story is good the graphics and the characters and last but not least paimon a very cute emergency food and i hope i will get lucky in wishing and get 5star im saving up a primogems and wait for hu tao event banner that's all thank you.\n","\n","554)Hi can you optimize it more\n","\n","555)Amazing game with nice combat system, exploring world is enjoying, character with amazing voice and art and quest and lore are deep and filled with mystery.\n","\n","556)Wow nice good good good graphics\n","\n","557)This game is very enjoyable and I love the scenes and lore it's really fun and I hope more people will play this game so they can also see how cool this game is\n","\n","558)entertaining\n","\n","559)Amazing game\n","\n","560)This is good\n","\n","561)Just amazing the graphics are very cool\n","\n","562)An awesome game. Well done guys. keep it up 😍😍😍\n","\n","563)one of the best and havey game for smart phon. But it was so lag in Mi a2 lite . please improve this .\n","\n","564)Please adopt Diablo Immortal controls. Very hard to play on tablet as left navigation wheel is fixed. Edit: Found playing in PC is way better.\n","\n","565)NICE\n","\n","566)Nice\n","\n","567)One of the most densest and dynamic storyline. The details to every aspect is insane. Graphics are vivid and beautiful. Open-world gameplay gives you the freedom of fun and adventure. A good experience.\n","\n","568)Keren dh top cuma bisa di optimal in lagi ga ya buat saya yg user mediatek biar rumput nya keliatan walau ga terlalu pekat min\n","\n","569)It's like I've stepped into another world...

I suggest to watch a beginners guide to this game because you might run into some troubles with how things work. Play this if your lucky.\n","\n","574)I really really like that game it's super fun but what I hate the ad is like just boys play dis game genshin I know u have to make one karakter but it looks like only the boy is the traveler so yeah that all but DOWNLOAD DIS SUPER NICE PRETTY GAME 😍\n","\n","575)I love it!!\n","\n","576)Best gacha game ever, I love the skill effects, the daily commissions, the events, the bosses, I also love competing with my friends to see who does more damage, it is very fun, I oso love my luck in genshin, thx genshin for getting me yoimiya!!!!\n","\n","577)ok siya\n","\n","578)PLEASE MAKE ME WIN 5050 LIKE LAST YEAR AGOOOOO\n","\n","579)Really nice but i need more rewards hh\n","\n","580)Best game ever\n","\n","581)Good\n","\n","582)One word awesome ❤️\n","\n","583)Nice game very good graphics\n","\n","584)I'm purely in love with genshin it always distracts me for a while and u end up playing until dark.

Thanks\n","\n","589)This game is the best\n","\n","590)Love the game. The scenery, characters, nations, plot, f2p, easy to obtain stuff or character u want without using real esp when you f2p!

And some of the events have bad storys imo so even doing them wastes so much of your time reading boring dialog which is unskippable. Also many of the events add new mechanics that are just very unpolished. And they have a tendency to add in mechanics that they just decide to never use again maybe to bloat the game. Where they could have polished the features and added onto them.\n","\n","2)While I really like this game in general, they just can't stop forcing you into cutscenes when you want to do something else, like I want to do some dailies and I'm forced to either skip or listen through 20-30m of story portions at a time... This is really annoying I want to do story parts when I have time, so if you are looking for short bursts of gameplay I sadly can't recommend this game.\n","\n","3)The devs are tone deaf--2 years later and that hasn't changed. This game still doesn't have quest nesting. It still doesn't have dialogue skip. It still hasn't reworked the artifact system that's driving people away. It still doesn't compensate players properly for their time. It still doesn't have controller support for Android. It still doesn't factor any player feedback into the roadmap. 2 years later, this game still has all the flaws it had since launch. Way to preserve Eternity.\n","\n","4)This game was fun at first, but someone got on my phone and deleted the game. I logged back in with my Google account, when I clicked they play button it tried to make me download it again, which absolutely shoked me. Not only does it take at the least an hour to download, it also meant that I had lost all my progress. I have been playing for months now and got my dream characters are everything, Nope! It's all gone now. This makes me absolutely furious. Please help me get my progress back......\n","\n","5)I've lost motivation to play the game. It's extremely repetitive after you catch up to the main story, all that's left is log in do daillies use resin log off. To the point where I now only log in for occasional mail primo gems. It doesn't help that the rng is abysmal. My history since the launch I have not won a single 50 50 and have used my entire saving of gems everytime there's a specific character I've saved up for, it just gets a bit wearisome, but that's the nature of gambling I guess.\n","\n","6)If I describe this game in one sentence it's totally whole new level of open world games. But the problem is limited work. This game is amazing and beautiful land . But the story & Quest r limited. It's playing fun in the starting but after some time U feel awfully boring because u have nothing to do. Just daily login and do some comition 2 or 3 Boss/Domain than logout. New update always bring same thing again boring rewards and item. I'm sick of than My suggestion is increase Original Resin\n","\n","7)SLOOOW! This game would be great if upgrading anything at all didn't take an act of congress. You want to do this mission? You gotta raise your adventure rank, which takes forever. You want to upgrade your character so you can raise their level? Too bad because the item you need is in a place way above your level in the first place. Want to upgrade your weapon level? That material is in a locked trial until you hit adventure rank 25. I have ADHD so this game has now lost my intrest and my money.\n","\n","8)3.1, way too many cutscenes and interruptions to gameplay, way too much dialog. This is a video game, let us play the damn game and let the lore be optional. For those who want to explore the lore, they can ask the NPCs lore type questions and get more information. The rest of us don't want to read an entire book in a small chat box when all we want to do is play the damn game.\n","\n","9)Worst stamina/equipment system ever designed. You can play for months and not gear your characters because it's all RNG biased against the player. Log in for same boring dailies, spend stamina and lose the RNG, get nothing, log out frustrated yet another day. It has okay story, annoying puzzles, good animations but trash system that pushes away players.\n","\n","10)I've been waiting for some sort of communication about when this issue will be fixed with Samsung S22 phones. It makes the game unplayable on mobile. Some characters are only floating faces. Half of the bosses either have missing textures, or freeze, heat up the phone and crash, or both. I got Tighnari and went to Sumeru to kill the boss the character needs for level up. Surprise! ANOTHER NEW boss that glitches my phone so bad I can't even exit the app anymore, I have to reset the phone.\n","\n","11)This game is cool and all, but for a beginner it's kinda difficult to get used to, and it's hard to get characters. I have also failed a few too many times at the flying/gliding test thing T^T. Alr so I loaded it up after around a month of not playing it (Took an hour to load+update) then I got onto the game and all my progress was gone. I was back at the start. What happened?\n","\n","12)RNG is really bad in this game. Fun, but still no controller support for Android (despite all other platforms having it) and it seems they intend on keeping it that way. The game itself runs worse with each update. I've had to turn graphics settings down just to keep the game playable every single time now due to updates. I think this game is comparable to games like craftopia. You could make your own fun in the beginning but it quickly gets boring.\n","\n","13)Event quest is locked because npcs are involved in other quests. I gave up progression in other parts of this game because of this senseless mechanic. Remove it so unnecessary and takes away from game rather than adds to it.\n","\n","14)Very good game, greedy company, bad communication, trash rewards, and horrible gacha. But other than these stuff, the game itself is amazing with graphics music story characters and everything else is amazing. Sad thing Is that the current new characters we have been getting and weak. The anniversary is also same as last time which sucks\n","\n","15)I've been playing since launch and spent a consequent amount of money in the game. A few weeks ago my account has been hacked and sold, and Hoyoverse won't give it back to me even though I have solid proof that the account is mine (purchase receipts, precise information about the account...). I filled the form to retrieve a stolen account, provided all the necessary information, the proof, and my application got rejected. I am extremely disappointed in the customer service.\n","\n","16)This game is amazing! It can keep you entertained for hours, has beautiful graphics and doesn't even have ads. I like the open world factor, the characters, landscapes, voice acting, all of it! I really recommend it, unless you have a not very good phone. Although you can also get it on pc. overall great game! I've turned it down to one star because I'm sick of the blatant whitewashing and lack of black representation. fix it.\n","\n","17)Good game but sadly I can't play it. I have a galaxy S8 tab ultra and with the tablet being so big it's impossible to enjoy with the touch controls so please add controller support game been out for years with no support on that end so I been on tower of fantasy until that's added\n","\n","18)I want to love this game, and I have for the past two years, but now? It's unplayable. Lag on mobile is to a point where I can't even do my daily commissions. I was so excited to explore sumeru but I can barely even take two steps in without the game performing at the same speed of a lame badger. I just want a switch port\n","\n","19)After downloading genshin on my phone, it lags in the way of any time I hit an enemy, it literally deducts no life from them. No matter what move or who I use. I literally cannot fight in the domains because I will always lose due to this. It also has been seriously delaying my ability to switch character and is getting to a point where I no longer want to play. How can I improve my stats when I'm getting screwed? Rn the app is just taking up space on my phone that I could use for a useful game.\n","\n","20)Not only does it force you to watch the opening cinematic before you can adjust graphics settings, it makes you do the tutorial. This is unforgivable. Also, the Razer Kishi works with the iOS version but not Android, what the heck? Waste of a download.\n","\n","21)Unending grinding with the same enemies again and again, I liked the exploration part of the game more but the game keeps throwing you into meaningless battles so it ruined that too. It feels like you waste your time without feeling like progressing.\n","\n","22)The translation into Latin American Spanish is simply terrible. Texts and dialogues are full of misspellings and grammar mistakes, making it really hard to read and understand. Mihoyo should consider translating the game into a more neutral Spanish that can be understood by all\n","\n","23)Look I love the game and it runs great on my pocofone but the game is just way too big at this point. Like dude I don't have any room anymore. Maybe if there was an in game option (cause a lot of phones don't allow this without root) to allocate all the data onto an sd card then it would be amazing. 20 gigs is just ridiculous imo. Please make data and obb location to SD card a thing. you don't allow this game on shadow pc and I can't play this game anymore because of these two issues\n","\n","24)Well the would've been fun if it wasnt for the one of the worst mechanics ever in video game if you throw an enemy off a cliff or if they accidentally fall down or you get out of their reach for a couple of seconds or at times when you manage to outrun the enemies for a while thr game simply respawn the emeny with full health and some of them take like 1000 hits to go down and can literally one shot you and the game simply reset the enemy when they're about to kill them after 10 mins of combat\n","\n","25)I have been playing this since day one and even bought a ps5 to play this with no loading times. I downloaded this on the phone to do some daily tasks when i was away, but to my surpise this game doesnt support controller. I find perplexing that it does support it on ios but not android. Can anyone explain why...?\n","\n","26)Worst gacha experience I've personally had even 2 years later. Now they keep archiving my account so I can't even log in when I want to play unless I wait 3-7 days after I reach out to them to un-archive my account for some reason. If I try to sign in with my email, it starts a new account. With having money invested in my previous one I don't want to restart, nor should I have to.\n","\n","27)Offline play could exist since is a single player game. if travelling or where there's no internet cant play. Resine points are a problem, play for 20 minutes and finish can't do anything anymore. Resine points takes hours to restore, WISH to GIVE 0 🌟. 16 GB to download same as PS5 (i have one) is to much. Android devices dont need same resolution as PS5. my mobile is Iqoo 7 sd 888. Very BAD service.\n","\n","28)Since Chasm update, even flagship CPU lag on genshin. I just recently bought a new snapdragon 8 gen 1 ram 12 gbs. I can play other games; apex, pubg with extreme fps with zero problem. Your game required huge optimization. Maybe some of your algorithm has unnecessarily too high time complexity, or maybe you over print debug log.\n","\n","29)Dumb way of linking accounts. Let's say you start on PS4 then want to move onto PC or your phone. Want to make a purchase? Oh, too bad it has to be on the device you originally started the account on. This logic is so stupid, like they really expect me to boot up my PS4 just to buy stuff? When many games can already do it from multiple devices? Yeah this ain't it guys. Give us the capacity to switch registration accounts on devices.\n","\n","30)What a game! I played it just for three days and already addicted to it, but for now my phone can't run it smoothly. I'm coming back for it once i have the chance. Such a game! Update: I just lost my account when I reinstall it and there is no support. That's one of the worst experiences I've ever had.\n","\n","31)This is the most expensive game I have ever played or heard of. I could have purchased a car for what I've spent on this game just to unlock the characters. If you don't have the characters, there's a lot you cannot do in game. Yes it's fun, but it would be irrisponsible to recommend this game. Also, that's now TWO unacceptable anniversaries where the company pretty much insulted its own clientele. No explanation necessary here, just google Genshin anniversary and you'll get the idea...\n","\n","32)Literally unplayable on mobile. The particle effects lag my device so hard that it takes me an hour to do the amount of gameplay that I usually get done in 10 minutes on console. Even the menus frequently fail due to probable memory leaks.\n","\n","33)Looks great and plays smoothly but the drop rate is absolute garbage! Not even Summoners war has a drop rate this terrible. The lack of weapon diversity is also pretty bad, all 3 star trash. Good luck getting anything else without spending hella money. You can grind for things but it's incredibly tedious and not worth the trouble, takes weeks just to get the bar minimum of needed items for important things. Game seriously lacks in all the important areas that make a game fun outside of story.\n","\n","34)THIS IS NOT A MOBILE PHONE FRIENDLY GAME 👌 it lags a lot even if im at my ultra lowest settings, the storage capacity is so large that you need a seperate dedicated phone with only this game installed to be able to play it semi-smoothly. updates are so large that some mobile users are forced to replace phones that have larger RAM and storage just to keep up.. if you're a mobile player-only like me, i recommend to use an ultra high-end phone just to keep up at least until their natlan release.\n","\n","35)Awesome game potential, horrible implementation, the character designs, world building, puzzles, lore and everything around these lines is so great but the gameplay us awful. Open world gets stale really fast, oculi are a chore that needs hours to be completed, using resin and doing comissions takes too much time. Added difficulty everywhere using time limit instead of making the enemies actually challenging. Plus the free rewards and rates as a gacha are terrible.\n","\n","36)It's really unfortunate, I really was interested in playing the game, but I only put one star because I wasn't able to get it to play. I downloaded it on my Lenovo Chromebook with lots of free space(I practically emptied everything for this game regardless)and yet it would load for literally hours but never start. I tried it three times, I tried downloading it on a different device, I tried using a different wifi source but it never works, it just drains my battery. :/\n","\n","37)I love genshin but after sumeru update it's become unplayable I have a phone thats only a little over a year and a half old and even on lowest graphics and nothing else running in the background Im getting content huge frame drops fix it and it'll be rated 5 stars again until then I can't play this game.\n","\n","38)Boring story and writing, the game is a huge snooze fest and talking simulator with unnecessary long dialogues, everything in this game feels like a chore, not a single event feels fun to play. There is no quality of life improvements or endgame content, you repeat the same boring daily commission and use resin worth 15-20 mins of gameplay and log out since the game launched. The only thing good about the game is the graphics but that gets old pretty quickly. The game is also very predatory.\n","\n","39)I hope I can give it a negative rating. Why can't your game work on mid entry phone? Didn't you have a cloud version of genshin? Why can't we have that instead of making it exclusive in china. That cloud version even takes less storage on your phone. It frustrating on the side of people who can't afford pricey phones or computer. We also want to play but won't let us eventhough you can already address this problem via cloud version.\n","\n","40)Overall,the game is awesome but the problem is that we low end Mobiles user don't have the some features in the game such as grass,ice damage, and bug with dvalin,La Signora,Yun jin and Raiden's shield. The lag is awful and it has to be fixed ASAP.\n","\n","41)This game has atrocious loading times, i had this game for 5 days and never played it once because i got bored of seeing the words \"preparing to load data\". Im glad that i got to see a loading screen tho. Very \"immersive\"\n","\n","42)Mobile always has issues with loading after the update. Currently 2.7 stuck at elemental loading screen and cannot play the game. Artifact grind sucks too. So don't play it. UPDATE: got help from developers, still did not fix problem.\n","\n","43)Fix the laucher in pc version. So much data and time wasted and I still haven't play it until now. Just use the older launcher, the new one which is 3.1 is bad and worst. The \"repair\" button only there to force us to download all game which is 45gb+. Why is it always the launcher.\n","\n","44)Terrible. I might like it IF I GOT TO PLAY IT. it required 16.75GB!!!! I cleared 17GB it still says, \"not enough storage space. Please restart once you have enough space!\" i cleared so much stuff to play this app and this is what happens? Terrible. Also, i'm not supporting the game. And im not gonna reach out to you via email as i already said the problem, and you clearly saw it. Please fix, and ill probaly up to 5 stars.\n","\n","45)Its a fun game but i cant remember the story because im not able to progress. The adventure rank wont let you play story missions unless you go do arbitrary tasks for hours first. I have no idea whats happening in the story any more because of this so ill probably just stop playing all together.\n","\n","46)Hello. I started the game last year and i've made a lot of progress, but two months ago i had to uninstall the app from my phone, now that I downloaded it again , i cannot access my previous accounts. It doesn't accept my email id anymore and I have to play the game from beginning. I am very disappointed. Adventure level 1 seriously??!!! I don't want to start from level 1 again , do something.\n","\n","47)I've collected the chest in the \"and the treasure goes to...\" quest in co-op mode, but I didn't get the 40 promogems and other reward for completing the quest.Can you fix it.\n","\n","48)I saw an ad for the game and thought, \"Hey this seems nice lemme download it\" so I do and after regsitering (on a new chromebook that I got a few months ago) I was excited to see what it was all about but, as soon as I try to begin a message pooped up on my screen saying, \"Insuffcient storage space. Please ensure sufficient space and try again\" But I have enought space for the game to do its downloading. Which means this game is a total waste of time to anyone who wants to actually play the game\n","\n","49)The customer service takes weeks to respond. They do not provide compensation for the lost log-ins as well and most of the players here in our area had \"account or password error\" pop ups even though we typed in the correct credentials. I used to love this game but for a grossing popular game the customer service is just terrible.\n","\n","50)I have been playing since day one and after the 3.1 update livestream , I feel betrayed and worthless after the second anniversary rewards, I feel like the devs don't care about us, 20 wishes is not enough for supporting the game and the money I spend on it, I love the game and it hurts me to see that our loyalty is not founded upon. Hopefully the devs have better reward for us.\n","\n","51)Due to the incredibly flawed cross-platform linking process, I ended up with 2 acc & no easy way to fix the issue. 8/24/22: Emailed for help. 9/5: Still no answer, FWD the last email. 9/8: First reply; need to send ANOTHER email to a diff address. Received auto-email with a link to a form to fill out. \"10 working day wait\" 🙄. Still nothing fixed as of today, 9/14. ⭐️: Gameplay 4/5. Customer Support 2/5. Linking 0/5. Ease of use 2/5. Overall, the game is nice.. Just wish the CS service was also.\n","\n","52)As someone who reached AR 50. I can tell you this game is good for you if you wanna do the same thing over and over again. I starterd playing June this year and yes, at the beginning there's seems a lot things to do but when you reach AR 40 it would start to feel lifeless. The resin system sucks too aside from having hard time to earn mora you have to wait 24 hours for 160 resin. I have three 5 stars character but that's not enough for me to be hype up to play this game.\n","\n","53)If ever this game have skip in a story quest . This is a 5 ... The story is very boring for some . Like me. I just want to play . But i need to finish my quest to go in the end.\n","\n","54)This is one of the worst games I have ever played. After playing for a couple of hours it has not done anything to hook me in wether it was the barebones story. Boring and bland combat. And the amount of mindless grinding I had to do just to level up and continue playing the game. Don't waste your time with this game, especially if you plan on spending money for a character. Buy an actual game instead.\n","\n","55)It's slow when I play and it keeps kicking me out the pass 2 times after I defeat the 3 crystals of the wind it just kicked me off of the game this game is the worst game I've ever played idk why they don't fix it and make sure it's right the first time\n","\n","56)This game has terrible security. 2fa is non-existent. If you ever get hacked, you'll have to beg them to help and they tend to do a really bad job of retrieving your account even with evidence. Or maybe you'll never get your account back at all. I have spent quite a lot of money on this game and still haven't got my account back. I used to recommend Genshin to everyone but now, forget about it. Time to move on and play/spend your money on something else.\n","\n","57)Getting to difficult now have to YouTube every quest to work out how to do and endless conversations with npc's. Pay to play if you want good characters or anything. Barely play anymore as takes hours to complete anything for pathetic rewards.\n","\n","58)bro please, after the 3.1 my phone always force close it. please, optimize your game. i want to play this game too.. i wanna save for scara. :( and now i can't even open the game because the game always force close when im at Sumeru (b4 the apps close i teleport to sumeru because i want to unlock the teleport waypoint :D) please help, this is my favourite game and theres no way i will uninstall this. thank youu :(\n","\n","59)After the Sumeru update the laggyness is unbearable, i had to go from Highest to normal settings, yet still expece freezing. I won't play until at least some optimization is done.\n","\n","60)Bro now Im getting really pissed off about this game,recently i was playing a mission called,\"Defeat Marana's Avater\".In this mission I had to defeat a stupid boss 3 times and for that,each time I had to go to 200m distance to purify an area using only traveler.The worse part is there is bunch of water holes in those areas.I already died two times and they force me to play the boss fight from the very beginning. Bro I literary played 20 min and died 2 times.GG Im leaving this game forever.\n","\n","61)Again mihoyo? Now this game even lagging than before, it's not when i opened the character tab, it's not because i'm playing at the highest graphic, BUT I'M PLAYING BY THE DEFAULT GRAPHIC, AND I EVEN SWITCH IT TO 24 FPS, BUT THAT EVEN MORE LAGGING THAN 45 FPS SETTINGS, TELL ME WHAT HAPPEN AT YOUR PLACE, SOMEONE DRUNK OR WHAT\n","\n","62)The CS is extremely slow to responsive. I'd like to start the game as soon as possible again but having my account stolen is really hampering the motivation. I beg the CS to team to address this issue asap.\n","\n","63)Buff cyno his damage is worse than a electro 5 star in standard, Mihoyo fix your game it isnt fair for us people who waited a year for his release and just get a electro male worse than keqing\n","\n","64)Another bad anniversary\n","\n","65)2nd anniv and the rewards still suck... still no end game 😑 and lastly no contact\n","\n","66)Late game makes the game grindy and it becomes boring after a few days. There's barely any motivation for me to log in now due to the lack on content in the game. The company also doesn't listen to the communities feedbacks as much with things they can improve on and it truly upsets me. The incident in the anniversarys effects are still lingering. I can't look at genshin with the same opinion anymore\n","\n","67)Why are the anniversary rewards still so bad. Like 3 days worth of resin and a useless gadget and pet. For playing for 700 days...\n","\n","68)hear this new player don't make the same mistake as i did.try to level your fav character first and try to do any dungeon as you can because when you reach AR rank 30 your attack won't even scratch a normal hilicurls at level 30+.after you rank up game becoming more a p2w as you need item or 5* character.but sure game still fun to play but a bit grindy\n","\n","69)greedy bastards! 0 Stars! this game can be played only if you pay serious money. being a f2p or buying small makes the gameplay a living hell. extremely hard to get decent character which is useless unless you get it several time to unlock constellation, items extremely rare, hard to get and to upgrade, you can barely beat bosses. 90 summons for a 5 star? i make 14000 primogems in 2 months! you are freakin insane! never seen such a greedy game developer\n","\n","70)make a skip button for dialogues or just make it shorter because it gets super annoying to read such boring dialogues\n","\n","71)Please released more male characters. The Ratio to females to males is 28:13 and it is unfair. Meta is too imbalanced and female characters are too Overpowered. Storyline got even worst and story seems to be like a date which does not make sense as they are *IN THE MIDDLE OF A BAD SITUATION* and also buff Cyno he sucks\n","\n","72)Waste of time😡😡😡😡\n","\n","73)This game needs 13gb of download in-game very disappointing\n","\n","74)It's gettin buggy in Asia server lately that i keep on getting 999ms but my internet is fine.i play other game smoothly no lag but genshin is easiest ping rise to 999 everytime i play it\n","\n","75)Waste Don't ask download 18GB ok you are very Bad\n","\n","76)No controller support on android. Pointless to even try and play this.\n","\n","77)You stupid developers, the game is crashing frequently after 3.1 update. Fix that quickly. Worst maintenance.\n","\n","78)I play on both PS5 and mobil yet i cant buy primos on my cell because the account was made in PSN plz fix this i have alot of funds in my google account and rather use em here On another note ios users have control support since v1.3 we are now on v3.0+ yet no controller support epic fail mihoyo.\n","\n","79)BING CHILLING 🥶🍦\n","\n","80)Sad\n","\n","81)So I downloaded the game on a new phone not used at all empty with a lot of space and the game won't do the update cause it errors on the insufficient space what do I do?\n","\n","82)Horrible character design. Is a racist company\n","\n","83)They didn't reset my shop (crystals double pack) after 3.1 update :/\n","\n","84)A month or two ago I would have given it 4 stars, now... It's just boring. Totally burned out on it. The grind is terrible. The quest rewards are trash. Resin Regen is too slow.\n","\n","85)Bad\n","\n","86)Dongeng berkedok game, isinya cm cerita yg gak bisa diskip. Battle 1 menit selanjutnya tap2 dongen smpe 1 jam\n","\n","87)Worst game ever\n","\n","88)Trash the ping sucks always shows 300+ms have been like this since launch and not fixed till now pathetic.\n","\n","89)I have enough space still theres a caution that I'm low on space sorry i can give it only 1 star\n","\n","90)F**king this game\n","\n","91)Your Ytube ads so stupid and annoying. Please change the ads. Useless\n","\n","92)They changed the model of Scaramouche, so I'm angry.\n","\n","93)I used Facebook to log in to this game and my Facebook was hacked. I don't recommend it\n","\n","94)Two years and the same mistake repeated twice. I will never feel truly appreciated by this game that has made 3.7 billion. The game's performance consistently gets worse in new areas, and now I'm even seeing glitches and lazy shortcuts in new quests that shouldn't exist.\n","\n","95)When you open this game it needs 18000 mb of data to downlode resources f....k it game\n","\n","96)For the past 2 years of the game, I'm tired of the dev. This review should be self explanatory\n","\n","97)Worst game 18900.35mb asking for game to play this is no1 frud game play appp\n","\n","98)This sucks! I can't even get to login!\n","\n","99)Couldn't even play the game as it required over 18gb at the loading screen after the install\n","\n","100)Gacha? More like gotcha. Huge waste of time, literally a money sink that gatekeeps your progress for no reason in particular. Do you want to play the main story? Nope you can't, go do some random stuff that is repetitive and boring until you get to a certain level and continue. This would not be the biggest problem in the world if the gameplay loop was better but on top of that the gacha system makes this game a literal trap that wastes your time and money, avoid if you value those two things.\n","\n","101)20gb game\n","\n","102)Game crash and framing after 3.1 update\n","\n","103)This game is suck at all\n","\n","104)I could say it's a fun game to play but I can never really get the whole experience of playing the game, anytime I open the game and it fully loads in like 5 seconds later it freeze and I don't know how to stop it from doing that, people on Google say lower the some the graphics settings but I can never do that because it always freezes before I get the chance too. But overall a pretty good game.\n","\n","105)Gets repetitive really fast. Fun for a mobile action game, and the elemental match-ups are a neat quirk, but the dailies are boring and the farm-able content (Artifacts) has terrible RNG rates (and is /also/ repetitive). It's good enough for a quick diversion every now and then, but now that it's asking for even more space on my phone than the monstrous chunk it's already taking up, it's an easy choice to uninstall.\n","\n","106)I've almost completely lost interest in this game and due to it's considerable size in storage I'm deciding to delete it. This game just isn't worth it, trying to level up is annoying and just moving around is hard. In the recent update there was a fight with two geo monsters which was too freaking much even for someone with level 80 characters I'm done with this game and am just going to watch the cutscenes on YouTube cause that's all I was here for. I did love the game but it's ruined now.\n","\n","107)This used to be a great game, but each update is lazier than the last. It's just hours and HOURS of boring, repetitive dialogue now. (And cutscenes you can't skip) The current event is nothing more than selling stuff and changing the in-game clock. I regret ever spending money on thos game, because the developers used it to line their pockets instead of actually developing the game. Bring back puzzles and real exploration. It's supposed to be a game, not a novel.\n","\n","108)Been playing off and on with BlueStacks emulator on the computer. It's a great concept, but I wish you can delete side quests you don't want to play, or which seem too frustrating or repetitive. The gameworld seems too restricted and repetitive to the point where some areas are annoying, and make no sense to continue. The entire upgrade system is a mess. I will not be playing anymore. This didn't hold my interest for more than a few days.\n","\n","109)Game is very good but later on it gets impossible to play. There is so many missions, and it'd normally be amazing, were it not for the sheer amount of dialogue in the game. All characters do is talk talk talk. Give us an option to skip ALL dialogue please!!!! Such a waste of time!!! Some of us get tired of the story. Especially cuz we don't care that some guy in Liyue wasn't paying their taxes! BORING. I love exploring and fighting. Not sitting there killing brain cells due to infinite talking.\n","\n","110)Horribly optimized for phone, barely optimized for computer. Prices are ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Not the worst Ive ever seen, but $30 wont even get you a 10-pull (unless you have the never-been-purchased-before bonus). The story and characters are fantastic, honestly its the only thing that keeps me coming back every now and then, but if you have a hard time controlling yourself when it comes to *cough* gambling, please save yourself and dont get invested in this game.\n","\n","111)Overall this game is fun, but after a year of playing and being ar 56 it feels like there's not much to the game anymore. Other than events and archon quests, it's just commissions and grinding domains for trash artifacts. Of course if you want to invest your time in this game and enjoy it, all the power to you. It just feels repetitive, and not to mention how laggy it is on mobile. Teleporting, enemy load-in in domains, and spiral abyss take 20 seconds now. My experience turned from 🥰 to 🙁\n","\n","112)I love the game and the story. But I had to remove it because my phone can no longer handle the game. Constantly lagging and/or freezing. Movie Scenes no longer play out. I hear the voices but the graphics only show fleeting glimpses of whats going on. Shame too. I really liked this game.\n","\n","113)Finally playing on PS5. The game needs contrast. On a phone it's a little easier to see stuff than on PS5 but only because you're physically closer to the screen. The colors all sadly, blend together, so it's quite hard to tell what's what. But it looks super nice. Just hard to see details... So far, great game, just needs some color adjustment. Update: the storyline doesn't make any sense.\n","\n","114)Truly evidence that popularity doesn't suggest greatness. The game is absolutely beautiful. But nothing you do has any substance. Story is boring and unskippable. There is little significance to exploration, because you don't need most of the things in the field. Food isn't necessary to progress in the game. Enhancing gear just feels like an annoying obstacle that you have to get through just so you can keep progressing. And, perhaps the most irritating thing is how clunky the transitions from activity such as swimming, climbing, etc. are to going back to walking/combat, especially during timed challenges. In fact, it's almost like the climbing time challenges are showcasing how terrible the game is at guessing when the player wants to climb up and when the player doesn't want to climb up. It's irritating during normal exploration as well since you'll randomly climb up trees for no reason. Not to mention, gacha rates are abysmal. I'm still going to play this because I like gambling with free resources, but to say that I like this game just because I plan to play it daily would be a complete utter lie.\n","\n","115)The game graphics and combat system is great. However, the adventure rank requirements for thr next missions are very annoying. Not only that, but obtaining primogems and getting good characters takes too much time that not a lot of people have. The drop rates for the heroes are extremely low. I spent $50 and got absolutely nothing good in return. Now I only play this game at least once a week for at least 15 minutes.\n","\n","116)(10/01) The game exceeds all expectations of a f2p game! The voice acting is incredible, the animations are gorgeous, and the world is so big! Bug: In Co-Op, I can't enter dungeons even after meeting recommended level requirements. Around Adventure Rank 30, progress slows dramatically. 4/5 stars. (10/12): This is a soul-sucking game with a 0.6% chance at 5* hero, and not enough variety to keep it interesting. Gameplay becomes repetitive with endless \"fetch\" quests.\n","\n","117)Not what I expected at all. Basically a single player game with grind heavy mechanics and limited multiplayer. The controls are pretty ass on mobile and you end up moving where you don't want to quite often. The camera is slow and takes it sweet time following the direction your character is facing. You can't move the camera and fight at the same time, so you rely on the slow ass auto camera most of the time. Theres no controller support, so have fun using the touch controls.\n","\n","118)I played the game pretty solidly for a while. Even paid for several of the monthly subscriptions and battle passes. But the thing that absolutely broke me were the artifacts. I have no problem with a grind. I have no problem with a time sink. But few things feel quite as disheartening as working for several months on a goal of improving a single character's artifacts and feeling like zero progress has been made after so long.\n","\n","119)While the graphics, character design, and storyline are all good, there are problems that prevent me from rating the game five stars like I want to. The first one is the lack of the ability to lock on to a target, the second one is the lack of the ability to end commissions that aren't designed for single players to complete, another is the terrible gacha rates been getting more weapons than actual characters from wishes. Until these are addressed, giving the game a two star rating\n","\n","120)Its a great game with beautiful graphics, a storyline with substance and a decent (or mediocre) co-op option depending on how much you like playing with others BUT there's just one thing that ruins the whole experience when you're knee deep in Genshin Impact, THE RESIN SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS, and limits the progression to upgrade your characters by a mile. It really differentiates a whaler between a F2P (and in the middle are of course, the goldfish > dolphins). If only the resin system wasn't so bad it'd be an absolutely amazing game. There's just a lot of things to be done but man the resin in just a knee capper. Just to clarify, I am at AR41 and have spent a bit of money on the game, and not speaking out of my ass, the resin system is just garbage.\n","\n","121)Great game, I play it on PC all the time. The Android version had an extreme oversight though in that there's absolutely no controller support. The drop-down to change from touchscreen to something else is there, but nothing shows up. Honestly pretty disappointed by that because the touchscreen controls are really bad. Will update if they ever change this but for now, I'm sticking to PC.\n","\n","122)the game is a pretty fun single player experience while you have quests to do. Once you hit the stamina wall (resin) then the game becomes a really poorly monetized mobile game. Getting new chatacters is very expensive, due to the fact that the it costs around 200 dollars to get a five star pity. Even after getting a new character, it takes almost a month's worth of resin in order to build them up to a usable level.\n","\n","123)Finished Stormterror's Lair, I can safely say that early on the gameplay is an absolute blast. However, this game has a few fundamental flaws that ruin mid-late game for me. The game relies heavily on stun mechanics, where the only way to defeat most enemies is to use continuous stunning attacks to prevent them from using their stunlocking combos. Resistance to attack interruption is an actual stat. The world levels up as you do, making grinding difficult. Sometimes controls stop working.\n","\n","124)At first everything was 5 stars, but then you get to the end and you get extremely gated. Collecting materials becomes a chore and you spend hours just running around the map endlessly for the 100th time doing the same route. Actual materials such as coins and xp require you to wait for resin and the game play that is tied to spending resin takes no more than a few minutes. It's fine if you want to enjoy the graphics, but don't bother spending money on this\n","\n","125)I came into this game really hoping to like it since everyone else seemed to like it, but there's too many issues for me to really enjoy it. First off is the awful quests you get sent on. They range from ridiculously simple to almost impossible to complete without a guide. Secondly is the level scaling with the overworld mobs and monsters. Mobs get way too strong and dungeons become nigh impossible. The story is interesting but it's locked behind your level and leveling up is a chore.\n","\n","126)The story is pretty bad. Like a really bad anime. The gameplay however makes for a pretty good RPG if you take the time to learn when to swap between characters and play to their strengths. The only real difficulty comes from the iffy touch controls. Considering this game has controller support on other platforms it was a pretty dumb decision to not allow the same control option for mobile players. Also...... Where the heck are the menu options? I can't find any sound or graphics settings.\n","\n","127)This could be a great game but there are three big issues. 1. Gameplay is locked behind a resin system. This means that you can only play 20 minutes a day. 2. Little to no repeatable late game content. Just the spiral abyss and the occasional easy event. 3. Wishes are very hard to come by (even standard wishes are rare), and they are very expensive in the shop.\n","\n","128)The games really cool at first but it starts to get boring as your adventure rank gets higher and there is less chests to collect and the quests get progressively harder, so it's hard to get primogems and that usually results in alot of people trading accounts and thats not the safest. Or some people just make new accounts and then again making new accounts all the time gets boring to because the story line is pretty repetitive after a while. And it takes a boatload of space.\n","\n","129)This game is purely beautiful, meaningful, and has very intricate character designs. But a major thing that bugs me that it's basically unplayable for Android mobile users because of the insane lag. It may be a me problem, but after opening the game, I instantly get kicked out after 5-10 sec. If that's not the case, then the gameplay is laggy and hard to deal with. Honestly, it's only enjoyable for the PC players at this point, thought I hope Mihoyo fixes this problem.\n","\n","130)Honestly, I have nothing to say about the anniversary rewards, as I don't really care too much about it. My review is because progression is super slow for a game, probably one of the slowest games I've played. It takes forever to level up your adventure rank past 25, as well as having to grind constantly just to level up your characters. The game is definitely more difficult when you dont spend a dime on the game to get the top tier weapons or characters, it's just not fun to me anymore.\n","\n","131)I have played this game since October of 2020. Without any amount of spending into account, Genshin Impact itself at it's core isn't a horrible game. The graphics are good, the controls are smooth, the combos on each character and elemental combos are nice. The story is interesting but extremely slow so far, with the game being out a year now and only one new area out of 3. Problems being resin being too restrictive for free to play players, making farming generally horrible across the board.\n","\n","132)I can not keep playing this game. Every time I start to get ahead I'm blocked by the arbitrary adventure's level. Other times it's the controls that screw me over as the camera may decide to face a different direction or my character just runs off a cliff. Trying to improve characters is down to pure luck in the gatcha as the drop rates are horrible. I really did enjoy myself once, but as I have gotten further in I only find myself becoming frustrated and uninterested.\n","\n","133)This game is almost unplayable. I don't know if this is specific to the pixel 2, but the game has a nasty habit of completely Disconnecting the wifi on my phone causing the game to have an error and have to reconnect. It does it every time I have to fight any enemies. The latency becomes 999 and literally no damage will be done. Good looking game that I've been waiting for, but right now this is unplayable with the network issues it has.\n","\n","134)When I first started this game, it was amazing. Lots to do, big open world, story quests. But as time went on, many of the issues became apparent. Electro reactions suck, artifact rng is horrible, no end game content, bad resin system, characters weak on release, character bugs never being fixed or addressed, and a bunch of other QOL issues. After community submitting feedback for over a year, nothing has changed and there has been no communication or acknowledgement of the glaring issues.\n","\n","135)Genshin has grown to be a beautiful game with potential to blow every other game out of the water. I have been playing it everyday since start! But lately, I already see the patterns of a game falling off the radar. One, it just doesn't feel like the game doesn't reward the players for their loyalty. Two, the promotions are coming from the players and the reward for all the hardwork put in is close to nothing. Three, the gacha system is terrible in this game, just awful. There's more sadly :(\n","\n","136)Before I begin, I wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, there are so many small issues I had within the first 45 minutes I couldn't continue. First, option settings not available right away, and when I did unlock them, they were very lackluster. Second, please put a lock-on feature. Third, please let us adjust control placements. The movement pad is almost awkwardly too far towards the center. Also, picking up items requires pressing the button in the middle of the screen, very annoying.\n","\n","137)Game is designed around scaling difficulty, so enemies get stronger with you. Once you finish all of the quests, the main gameplay loop involves doing things to make your characters stronger. The problem is there is only 1 permanent gameplay element where it matters how strong your characters are. So the core of the gameplay starts to feel pointless and repetitive. Add in poor quality of life, non-existent character balancing, and unfair RNG at every turn, and it becomes frustrating fast.\n","\n","138)I like the game so far. But whenever I'm in the middle of playing the game it randomly freezes then crashes. And the amount of freaking lag is so annoying. I'm playing the game on an android tablet. I love how pretty the stuff in the game looks, but graphics suck. It's a good game, just needs improvement.\n","\n","139)Ever since the desert update the game has become unplayable. The lag is unbearable. Don't give me that generic response on how I should check device requirements because I never had this problem before and my phone still has more than 10gb left of storage. In fact, I've been playing mere hours before the maintenance and I have never encountered any issues. It's the latest update that's the problem. You should stop advertising as a mobile game and just be a pc game if you're not gonna fix these.\n","\n","140)It was fun when you're starting playing it but as you progress, it will get hard at a certain point. If you have a lot of patience in building/upgrading a certain character you want, this game is good for you. Edit: Due to the new update, the game became laggy, keep crashing, and it's been hard to control the keys (to mobile users). I'm not satisfied in terms of the new setting update.\n","\n","141)Rewards for the anniversary the first time around was horrible, it seems like the second anniversary will repeat the same. The game is beautiful and fun to play but there is very less incentive to continue playing if the company doesn't change their money minded mindset. The entire playerbase was expecting atleast one 5 star. What do we get, 20 pulls. Pathetic doesn't even cut it anymore.\n","\n","142)Game has most annoying and useless non skippable dialog system. And dialogs is 50% of the game. They give you a choice in dialogs what does not changes anything. Many dialogs can't be skipped, so you must mindless tap on screen without a doubts what is going on. Guys, add this damn skip button please\n","\n","143)I really like the game style and the characters, the story is a bit dry for me but i continued to play it with my friends with no big problems but I logged in today and my entire account was just gone all the process I had was entirely gone and I really don't feel like trying to work my way back up so I'm just going to stop playing.\n","\n","144)Game is fun. But the game does not want me to play with new characters. Acquiring a character is very expensive unless you choose to skip many. And after acquiring, it takes weeks to be able to get them up to the level of my other characters. I just want to play with the new exciting stuff!... but I can't until I do the required farming. This isn't a game, it's a job\n","\n","145)Update: the longer the versions, the more that I get bored to the point that I've been forgetting my commissions. I lost motivation to the repeating game system. Things need to change because it gets more boring these days. The story is interesting and the view is incomparable but the in-game stuffs made me so bored.\n","\n","146)Good game and very very BAD service, contact is low, there's no response and no help, it says in 20 days time but never came after 2 months. Outragous and made it impossible to get an account once you or the security system made a mistake. And you will forever lose the account because contact support does not help.\n","\n","147)Update from prev. review: New 4* Sumeru units look amazing but have poor performance, disappointing even when compared to Inazuma 4*. Ascension mats are also getting more annoying to collect. Artifact RNG is still garbage. The graphics and BGM are amazing, but a game is much more than that. Rewards for contests are hardly generous. I cannot recommend supporting a greedy company that treats their playerbase like trash so don't spend money on the game, it's not worth it.\n","\n","148)Ever since the update, it's been super laggy.. after about an hour & a half of playing it will just straight up freeze on my tablet. Sometimes it just crashes. I've had to reopen the app twice now because regardless if I'm coop or solo it will freeze & not respond. I really want to enjoy the game so it's a bit disappointing. I hope they fix the issue soon. Put it to 2 stars bcs it seems like the team at Mihoyo don't bother to fix the issues that people complain about. Just read the 1?reviews.\n","\n","149)Updated 8/24/22 I absolutely adore this game, I've been playing for almost 2 years now, very consistently. There was only one occasion where I got busy and took a longer break from the game. I like the combat system, characters and lore especially, but for a long while, and especially as of recently, there's been an extreme lack of diversity. Hoyoverse is making their regions based off real places, with real people who do not look like how the game has chosen to represent them.\n","\n","150)CRITICAL FAILURE. The touch controllers are clunky. So most mobile players will opt to use a bluetooth controller. BUT BEWARE, this game bans users for attempting to use an external controller to play. And it's not impossible either, since it is supported and even recommended for Apple devices. Fix this issue please, it is hurting your game!\n","\n","151)Genshin is a gotcha game, but it actuelly has gameplay for once and a good story. The gotcha system is't bad either as there are restrictions in place to prevent having bad RNG all the time most events are funn aswell, sure there is still space for improvements and they mess up sometimes, but they still make it up. Found my self pretty addicted to this open world story driven game Edit: I regret those words\n","\n","152)love the new update, but now i cant even play without the app crashing. Not even five seconds into entering the game, it immediately crashes. Now the game is quite literally unplayable for me. Ive tried deleting apps and useless files but it was still fruitless. Hope hoyoverse could do something about this.\n","\n","153)The lack of controller support on Android is absolutely ridiculous. Why. Just why. Stupid. absolutely stupid. Game is fun but trying to play this on 10 inch or bigger screen tablet using touchscreen controls is a terrible experience. One that can be easily solved by adding controller support which iPhone and iPad already have. I'm very much frustrated and angry at whatever ridiculous justification there is for this lack of support. Fun game made frustrating by moronic decisions.\n","\n","154)I love this game a lot. However, after watching the livestream it seems like the anniversary rewards are the same measly 20 pulls as last year. I appreciate the music, new anime announcement and the hard work you put into this game. But it doesn't mean that you should make the anniversary less festive. There is really nothing different than the usual patches. I truly hope that you have planned something more on the 28th because this is disappointing.\n","\n","155)After the anniversary issue I took a break from the game. Came back and decided I will not play or put money into this game anymore. Why? Controller support or lack there of for Android devices. Simple as that. Pc and Apple both have it. Durring thebeta Android HAD it. And now we can't have it back? Good game otherwise but I'm not ending up with trigger finger again because they don't want to listen to their Customers.\n","\n","156)THIS GAME IS SOO BAD ON MOBILE. It is an amazing game for ps, or pc but as far as mobile goes it SUCKS. Mobile controls are soo bad and very unresponsive. My phone overheats just a few mins into playing and I can't really do much because of how terrible the controls are for mobile. Do not get it for mobile cause it is terrible and just way harder. Play on either PC or ps cause it is easier to control what ur doing and a lot more funm Would be much better if genshin added controller support\n","\n","157)Yes, the game itself was nice. A masterpiece music enough to soothe a tired soul. Although on recent update, Sumeru debut, game had become buggy, crashes the most which I go back time to time in loading screen and unstable server(usually in Asia server). Meanwhile on device running on minimum requirements, it throttle a lot. FPS drop is understandable on my side but game crashes is a no no to me as it ruin the gameplay and enjoyment of the game.\n","\n","158)Lately, the camera movement is getting stuck. The only way to make it working again is to reset the damn game. The bug is now always happening to me because I am now using Ganyu, hence I use aim a lot. Its kinda makes the game unplayable on android.\n","\n","159)Still boring after the Sumeru Update. The Sumeru Archon Quest is utter garbage with no exciting fighting gameplay experience. Dialogue goes for hours and hours and only less than a minute of actual gameplay experience. I play the game, of course, only for the reason that this is the only game of its kind. But I want the developers to be more creative about the gameplay aspect of the game.\n","\n","160)The game itself is beautiful but their isn't enough content for those who played the game earlier towards its release. The game has become really repetitive and bland doing boring commissions that most don't care about. The company or devs don't seem to care about the feedback sent by players because there's a lack of response/communication. The company really care about the money and doesn't connect with the players or fans. Storyline are rushed for the sake of having \"content\".\n","\n","161)Taking everything into account, this game is... bad, to say the least. I rarely see any reviews talking about how absolutely frustrating this game actually is. The graphics are stunning, the new character releases are fun, exploration is wonderful. The fighting is unbalanced, the puzzles are awful and migraine-inducing, and don't make me mention when you actually mix them TOGETHER. The lightning on the islands are horrible. Makes a calm person rage-quit like no tomorrow. Please fix this game...\n","\n","162)I want to say that I started to play this game around 9 months ago and on my old phone (Xiaomi mi 8) it worked without problems (except the overheating one that I think most phones suffer of). But now, on the Samsung S22 (Exynos) it has some really annoying crashes while in certain boss domains (example Signora). The boss would spawn only half (like only the head and the legs, and after getting to the 2nd phase, it completely freezes the game and the phone. So just 2* for the mobile vers. sadly.\n","\n","163)Ok, the game was fun when I first played it. It was fun exploring, but now theres nothing to do late game at all. Plus the game is very problematic with its character design, they refuse to represent darker skinned people, and they refuse to add diversity in other areas as well. It basically makes all of the characters look the same, and it gets boring. Sumeru, which is based off of south asia/africa, has maybe 2 characters that aren't paper white. I used to love this game, but now...\n","\n","164)Mobile support is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE along with the reson that you cant lower your world level past 4 like i want to go to world level 3 and i cant\n","\n","165)Please reduce this game's size. It's over 20gb now.\n","\n","166)I can't get into the game because of a glitch\n","\n","167)Sumeru story boring as hell\n","\n","168)Please fix somethings my phone kept on stop on working without any reasons and I'm forced to get out of the game I waited so long and it didn't continue I have a strong wifi and my other games woks fine unlike genshin that kept on stopping for no reason\n","\n","169)I love the game, but the game hates me. This game seriously makes me consider why I'm still living. Every aspect of the game is based on luck. And that's one of the millions of things I don't have. Thanks for managing to make my day worse all the time.\n","\n","170)Tbh the amount of space it takes up is not small and I feel like its not really worth all that space but t nonetheless less a fun game\n","\n","171)Hi genshin, I think this is the last version I play genshin because in mobile it sucks. I'm always having single digit fps while using low graphics. And now the game starts crashing more often. I really genshin will be optimised on mobile\n","\n","172)2nd yr Anniversary but it doesn't feels like an anniversary there are some rewards but a bit of trash compared to people who spends thousands of dollars in this game atleast appreciate those players who was there in your downtime and supported your game bcoz they love the game not bcoz they are entitled to.\n","\n","173)Love the game (been playing it for two years now) but the lack diversity and weird insistence on making paper white characters is disheartening\n","\n","174)The one problem is that the game lags even when I have the lowest setting. My phone starts to heat up after about 5 minutes, my Internet slows down the game. Everything else is all good: graphics, story, style and gameplay...but I haven't reached any further to unlock and explore every detail of the game so -1 star. . . . My ram and memory usage is too high to handle the game plus I had to delete almost every game just to play this one oversized app...\n","\n","175)I just recently uninstalled past quest resources which was around 3GB and today when I opened the game, it is saying to download 3GB resources. I don't even need that past quest resources. Without downloading I can't enter into the game. Please fix this.\n","\n","176)After the new 2.5 update, the game reflects to lunch\n","\n","177)This game requires a lot. Your phone must be more powerful than the computer so that I can run the game 💀\n","\n","178)It gets boring after awhile , everything gets repetitiv , and the ammount of primogens we get for 1 quest is laughable. Fix ur game or delete it\n","\n","179)I lost intrest in the game from v1.3 update. As the daily commission and other small quests are same old boring stuff.\n","\n","180)It's a very great game but the storage is getting bigger :(\n","\n","181)Don't forget dawnload due mb biocrpick 18576 mb I am not blve d\n","\n","182)I HATE IT AND LOVE IT AT THE SAME TIME! I ALREADY BEAT CHILD BUT THEN MY PHONE DIED AND I CHARGE IT BUT WHEN IN IT RESTART. I TOKE SOOO LONG TO BEAT IT JUST FOR IT TO RESTART??!!!! I WAS JUST SOO ANGRY IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN I'M LATTERLY GOING TO QUIT🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡.\n","\n","183)Very bad company\n","\n","184)The game is don't have support a microsoft elite controller 😕\n","\n","185)I would have rate it higher if only it has gamepad controller function for mobile, ow wait, you guys only did that for ios, guess I'll change my rating again. Desperately need gamepad controller function for Android.\n","\n","186)Boring game\n","\n","187)I would like this game a lot more on my mobile if they would hurry up and add controller support The game has been out for 2 years now And they still slacken\n","\n","188)I actually enjoyed the game very much but honestly even if I do like the game, story, graphics, animation overall it's just that the game feels dry and even with sumeru introduced I still dont find the game as fun as before\n","\n","189)goblok 1yr anniversary rewards edit: genshim impact 3.0 is too heavy for POCO X3 NFC 6/64 now , it's time to say farewell it was a bit fun journey but unfortunately i have to stop now.\n","\n","190)im not interested in playing anymore\n","\n","191)Ada fitur hapus data quest lama tapi kenapa pas login disuruh download ulang? Awalnya udh seneng bisa nurunin kapasitas genshin tapi kaget bgt pas tadi pagi login malah disuruh download datanya lagi🙏 (sebenernya ga tega juga sih ngasih rating 2 karna genshin game fav sy😅\n","\n","192)I was downloading the data in-app and i reached 14gb already then suddenly there was an update from playstore which i had to download to continue, after updating i entered the app and found that the download restarted😭😭even though the previous data is still there\n","\n","193)Games getting more boring as it goes but I do recommend for people who have no life\n","\n","194)there is nothing to do just daily boring routine and events two times a month\n","\n","195)Getting decent artifacts still sucks big time.\n","\n","196)Resin system should be fixed, ASAP. 160 is not enough, I wanna build ayato, Yun jin, yanfei and nigguang ffs. Gacha system kinda trash but as a f2p, I can manage. End game content, I don't really Mind if they don't add it bc I'm ar 56 and log in for commissions and then gtfo. Pls give us a chart course for artifact domains, I'm SICK of getting shim instead of emblem. And lastly, pls fix artifact rng, it's driving me crazy. To all the people who wanna play it, you need storage, A LOT OF STORAGE.\n","\n","197)Still a fun game but after all of the updates still haven't gotten a way to use a controller for android players and it's been getting a bit annoying\n","\n","198)The game keeps crashing after I updated. Can't enter the new Sumeru section. I'm currently using a Note 10 Plus. Customer service is not replying to my emai at all.\n","\n","199)Very bad gacha practices, game is good\n","\n","200)For a F2P, your progress will be >10x slower than paid and worse in performance. It's a stingy game. The good part about it is the graphic, provided the phone can support la\n","\n","201)Good game but is pretty bad on mobile. Unless you're playing on a super good phone or a tablet, playing it on mobile is laggy and not even playable unless you decrease the graphics. There is also not really any endgame content. I've been playing since 1.0 and once you finish the current story, exploration, etc., the game gets pretty boring until the next update. Of course for new players this shouldn't be a problem but everyone will get to that point eventually.\n","\n","202)Amazing game overall but constant issues if you're a mobile player, it's constantly freezing, lagging, crashing and overheating my phone to a worrisome point. The graphics are even at the lowest setting and I have plenty of space left over. The game itself also takes up rather alot of space I'd recommend playing on Playstation or PC if possible\n","\n","203)Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars because I noticed something extremely frustrating about the game. Certain quests soft lock co op play. There's this quest called trails of tianqiu. Now this quest is very difficult to complete unless you're high level, so being unable to complete this quest and with no way to abandon quests in-game, I'm stuck without being able to play co op for the next few months. I hope in the future they make a way to abandon quests because this is a serious problem.\n","\n","204)Really good game, been playing for almost 2 years now coming up to the second anniversary. But with each update it's been getting harder and harder to play, the app size is ridiculous and the unbelievable lag with each one. I've been able to continue playing on a different device, so I uninstalled genshin from my phone, at least until the issue is fixed.\n","\n","205)Great game. Lots to do compared to when it first dropped and grinding for AR levels. 1 complaint I have is dialogue. Like story missions especially. 3hours of no fighting and running around trying to skip all the talking. Please implement a SKIP ALL so we don't have to sit and play TAP TAP simulator on the screen to skip and get back to the game. I appreciate the hard work the voice actors did to add in all this useless dialogue. But sheesh. There should definitely be an option to void it all.\n","\n","206)After the most recent update, the game keeps crashing. It loads fine, but once I start playing, after I take a few steps, the game freezes and shuts down. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, but that did not help, neither did cleaning up my phone nor removing useless apps. What the heck is going on?\n","\n","207)Great graphics pretty solid game play biggest problem is some of the missions are next to impossible to beat due to the leveling system. Upgrading characters adventure rank fast to make fights easier screws your game up and makes it almost impossible to move forward through the quests. I feel the enemies need to be more balanced to your level to make game play more enjoyable. Months of time invested into upgrading characters and weapons still not making it any easier kinda sucks.\n","\n","208)Game is eventually very good unlike any mobile games. I face this problem every once in a while after every update, my game becomes laggy and choppy and sometimes even freeze. Playing co-op is almost impossible when it happens. Please optimize it for low end devices, even my flagship phone could not do it. Please consider it for mobile players around world, some of us really cannot afford consoles or pc. Apart from this issue that I face. I love this game, characters, lore and its truly f2p too\n","\n","209)It was a fun game but it's starting to lose its appeal. Getting characters and good artifacts is hard and the game continues to eat up my storage. The game is beggining to seem repetitive to me and I'm not as excited for the new updates as I was before.\n","\n","210)super entertaining,i love the characters and their designs,their personalities and the way they are in general...but after 2 years of playing it's gotten really REALLY boring. like...PAINFULLY boring. the events get tiring,the gameplay gets annoying,the building is strange and stupid to me and the whole wishing system? ugh! it's so FRICKING dumb!!\n","\n","211)The game is fun and exploring some places is ok. But the way lore gets presented is terrible, its only done by reading and not playing. The mc is silent but has a pre-existing personality which defeats the purpose of a silent mc. Sumeru is annoying to explore because it's mostly trees and caves, sometimes its hard to tell whether things are up in the surface or in a cave, and finding cave entrances is time consuming and boring. Also wish we could ride the Sumpter Beasts. Can't wait for Fontaine.\n","\n","212)It's an ok game. It's really fun when you start out but it gets really boring after a while. That and I've probably spent about $300 on the game and sorta got addicted to the gacha system. Not the greatest. That and I was met with even more disappointment by losing the 50/50 for the seventh time in a row today to yet another qiqi. So I might be a little salty when I say this but genshin isn't really worth playing. The game gets boring. you get addicted really easily. It's Not worth it to me.\n","\n","213)(Update) So my genshin has been crashing alot lately. Like sometimes it will crash in one or two hours and I really made a big deal out of it. But now its been crashing when i start playing the game to when I only complete one of the things I have to do in the archon quest. Please fix this Genshin\n","\n","214)I love this game but it not letting me download on pc and I think its kinda dumb that I cant when i already have it on phone as well. It says it can be played pc and mobiles. Edit: with the new update its not letting me in the game just crashes after it loads into the game. I got bad signal but even so it never crashed on me.\n","\n","215)I love this game and have been playing it for a while. But with this new update, my game barely runs. Barely any of the assets load in properly, textures don't show amongst other things. I want to continue playing, but I'm slowly beginning to struggle. I've spent hundreds on this game and made amazing memories on it and I'd hate to have to leave it.\n","\n","216)The Game is Good but in my device gameplay is capped at 30FPS, no matters if it was low/high graphics it just capped at 30FPS. Actually my device is capable of running in 60FPS but I don't know the reason they capped they game at 30. I am using Poco F3 GT with Dimensity 1200 with Mali G77 MC9 GPU which was capable of running game in High graphics. Do please optimize the Game for This device, It was gaming device but it lacks optimization\n","\n","217)I'm an AR 57 player and as much as I enjoy this game it has quite a few issues with it. First of all the resin issue. When you play genshin you use resin to get materials and artifacts. The problem is it takes forever to regenerate the resin you use so you get about 30 minutes of game a day late-game. Second the diversity. There is an extreme lack in anything diverse and there has even been racism n colorism shown in the company. If this matters a lot to you then this is not the game for you.\n","\n","218)The start of this game I think is extremely strong. However, when you've been playing as long as me, which is since Nov 2020, the game gets increasingly boring as u do similar quests or events for a few of the currency to pull characters. I do like this game, it's very polished and has rlly good design overall, no doubt. One thing that ofc needs some improvement is end game. The only end game content is abyss, and that already is quite basic. Enemies are rarely changed in abyss.\n","\n","219)a real review this time. im giving it 3 stars because the game is fantastic, but the storage it consumes is unbelievable. i used to play on an iPad 8, 32 gb and was heartbroken when i didnt have enough storage for the 6 gb 2.7 update. i just want you to lower the storage consumption, maybe make it that story and hang out quests are manually downloaded. i hope you do see this.\n","\n","220)It's a fun game, but overall there's just so much dialogue. It's extremely time consuming and boring. It'd be a different thing if the dialogue was actually important, but characters can ramble on and on about something that won't matter in 5 minutes.\n","\n","221)I rally like this gane, but i can't even olay because the game is constantly lagging and reconnecting to severs, this is incredibly annoying. And really not worth all the things i deleted and space it took up on my phone. Im so close to uninstalling this gane because it's is so annoying not being able to play without crashes.\n","\n","222)Game is frequently crashing even I am playing at the lowest graphics possible which in turn frustrating me to reopen it again and again and then after little time of playing it again crashes😠. Fixxxxx this cause because of this problem I am not able to enjoy the game.... I deleted dragon raja which works perfectly even at high graphics but this game even at very very very low graphics lags and crashes..... If you guys are do not know how to fix this, Go to dragon raja creators and ask for help\n","\n","223)could you add a feature where we can manually download each resources for the game instead of it automatically downloading all or atleast a way for us players to choose what we wanna download so that we can save up on even just a bit of device storage. for now im sad to say but im gonna have to delete the game from my device as it is taking too much space. I've already deleted lots of apps to make way for genshin. i will install it again when this is implemented. i think that it will be nice.\n","\n","224)its a good game but some issue that in the middle of a quest it crash and out of the game. and some quest you already finish is still in the list. im tired of reopening the game after it crash and closed. wish the problem is fix.\n","\n","225)I've been playing since the release and I consider that I have enough experience in order to say that Mora is the real premium currency in this game. Fk primogems, GIMME MORAAAA!! Besides that, the game has no endgame which makes it very plain and boring after a few months. It's that kind of game you only play for 1 week when it gets an update then bench it for the next 5 weeks. Good game overall, lovely characters, the story is a bit disappointing, but it seems to get better, so consider that..\n","\n","226)Oh how i wish i could give it a 5 rate but my android phone could take it but. I cant see damage:< Its so hard for me to showcase my characters:/ i cant see ice so i cant rllly ice bridge,my water glows and i cant see bc its bright,i have no grass,i cant see enemy health but im ok with the low graphics but more worst is not seeing damage.i hope you fix this bug and it helps me pls.\n","\n","227)So here's the problem. Take it from a gamer. Its not meant for phones. Playing on pc or console its amazing. My only issue with this game is the fact of developer locking character progression and even the characters themselves behind massive money pay walls. This game is great enough not to have to do that. Customizations with character outfits I get. Even weapon customizing with looks. But locking progression and trying to force a games length is terrible. Few other things but this is main one\n","\n","228)The game is amazing, although the anniversary is not. I am AR 50 and only have C1 Jean. I would like it if we got a free standard banner 5 star because playing with the same few people eventually gets boring. Please Hoyoverse, help some players out! I know the game takes a lot of time and effort to make, but I don't get to experience the full potential the game has to offer with the limited rewards.\n","\n","229)I like this game but it just crashes randomly 2-3minutes after starting the game please fix it. Edit: nvm i deleted this game its not good for my mental health it takes 5minutes to just load and it crashes after 2-3 minutes even after i turned on developers option and optimized the app.\n","\n","230)Hadn't the chance to play it, I couldn't download it at once so I had to continue downloading it whenever I had internet, after I got the update from play store, I lost all the download progress and had to start over :/ it was better if the graphic pack was optional or at least let the player download the graphics later on game.\n","\n","231)I really like the game but, I always crash in cutscene. Right now I'm a ar lvl 35 stuck because of the always lagging cutscene. It's not my device, don't doubt the newst phone s22 galaxy ultra not working on this game. And I have reinstall it 3 times. Might as well delete this game sooner or later.\n","\n","232)3.0: sumeru was great the art, music, good as always, but the archon quest was a disappointment, to much nonsense, and repeating the same thing over and over was a waste of time and annoyin, I also thought that when sumeru comes out the resin cap will increase but it didn't, and that is really bad now that we have 2 talent materials added, and 2 artifacts added, and weapon materials, and 2 bosses, do you think players can upgrade a character with only 160, and please balance the game, buff diluc\n","\n","233)I've played this game for a while and finding more and more problem about this game. Most annoying of them all is the combat, instead of having fun with the elemental reactions I first thought when I saw the game, the combat feels more like a chore and rank up quest is a nightmare and it's mandatory as you have to progress to go explore the other map.This makes my game experience ruined as what I like the most is the exploring and solving puzzles part.Also 5 star character rates are abyssmal.\n","\n","234)This game is really good but takes up a lot of storage and once downloaded grows from around 100mb to 9 gb. Edit: Now from around 7 months later it grows from 700mb to 13gb. For mobile players, graphics can be poor. Rewards in game are low and it makes the game harder to play for free to play players. Edit. Once you start playing it can be very addicting and compared to other games the characters are well designed just be wary on how much you spend\n","\n","235)Besides all the problematic character designs, which is ,indeed, a serious matter, I would like to add the fact that the quests are so time consuming for no reason. Some \"small\" ones have such heavy, forced dialog and you just can't for the love of God remember even 2% of its unrelated to the game whatsoever points.\n","\n","236)Decent app. The problem in my Opinion is Primogems are REALLY hard to get, basically when unlocking a Waypoint it gives you 5 Primogems, but it keeps lagging everytime i unlocked a new Waypoint, also everytime i lag it shows these pink weird things in my view, and could you PLEASE raise 5star Chances just for a bit? It would help alot.\n","\n","237)I've been playing this game since version 2.6. Totally satisfied with everything else except that I haven't got any weapon reward after defeating the boss for more than a couple of months now. It's really annoying cos I've been wanting to forge a weapon for my character for so long!\n","\n","238)I like the game a lot, but there is quite a few problems with it. The gacha system is too expensive, it's hard to collect primogems every day just for a couple wishes without buying any. Levelling up in adventure ranks is very difficult as well, there are only so many things you can do day to collect experience, the amount it all gives you is also really low. The third and final problem is just how big the game is, I've had to delete so many other things just to be able to even download the game\n","\n","239)I really really love this game so much, even though I'm a late gamer.I don't really care if my phone kept crashing(Vivo Y30 is my phone btw).But todays update, I can't really play much because of the lagging and crashing.Heck I can't even do my commissions, and I can't change my phone yet since its very expensive and I'm too broke to buy one. So I might uninstall the game for a while. Hope Hoyoverse is reading this.\n","\n","240)I bought a new phone before the sumeru update released, it actually runs pretty well until the current patch got realeased. It's basically unplayable at this point cuz i kept getting fps drops and it lags so hard. It almost kicked me out of the game becuz of it pls fix this even with the lowest settings in the game... My device is Realme GT master edition and the processor is Qualcomm® Snapdragon?778G Octa-Core and the ram is 8gb + 5gb ram Thank you\n","\n","241)It's kind of fun but sometimes you just don't know what to do and the quests are sometimes confusing and hard, and you barely get any rewards, you only get rewards on their anniversary and it's annoying\n","\n","242)I downloaded it because I was intrigued by it and i kept hearing a lot from this game. However, once I log in the game and it starts downloading it tells me there's not enough space. I deleted most of my apps, pictures, even songs! The phone is almost like it came: with nothing but google and such. Is it only me or am I doing something wrong?\n","\n","243)The fact that this game has been out for so long and still no dedicated controller support for android devices is ridiculous... smh... with ios devices, this game runs good with controllers.... seems like this is an easy fix, but I have no idea why they just won't add it\n","\n","244)I love the game away from the pay to play and u know that other games with same style gonna be released and doesn't have that annoying option but that's not the problem .. I changed it to a star cus i swear i could play this game with my dualshock but after i got phone update and the game update it doesn't recognize the controller any more only touchscreen option please fix and make support controller for android ...\n","\n","245)Bringing my rating down to 3. This game's internet connection suddenly became very laggy this past few days. My ping always goes down to 999, especially when I'm doing weekly bosses. It's just this app, everything else is fine. There's probably a problem in the server that needs to be looked at ASAP.\n","\n","246)The story and gameplay are cool for awhile, but when there is no fun event it's basically a dead game for ar 55+. I hope the dev, pay attention to the feedback given too since some of the event get so annoying i don't even care about the reward anymore.\n","\n","247)I love the map update but now it's just an endless mission! Dialogue upon dialogue which I have no idea what to finish first! No wonder player trying to install auto clicker because the dialogue is sickening!!!\n","\n","248)Really good game. A couple of annoying characters (why do they sound like small children?? Why does Paimon exist?), but a beautiful world. Unfortunately, the game has bugs which prevent me from completing main storyline quests, so I'm stuck until an update fixes it.\n","\n","249)Wth is happening? Ive reinstalled after 2 months and the moment I've opened my account, everything was reset. I was at the beginning of the game without any idea what happened to my account that I've spent money and effort on. i have different accounts and it all happened to all of them.\n","\n","250)Game is superb and fun to play. However, the response from support is slow and frustating. I've been trying to contact support due to a problem with my account as its already past its due date of the promise date. At the very least give me an update.\n","\n","251)It's fun. But at rank 33 I'm a little disappointed that getting any 5* weapon or character is a challenge. I only have one 5* weapon, zero characters. Getting 1 4* weapon every 10. A character imprint once in a full moon. The currency is also hard to get.\n","\n","252)Bad. The game is good but I have shifted to PC because my mobile could not support it. Though I am unable to play in PC as till now 9 times have my game downloaded till 40 gb or the full game and then it rebooted with all my downloads missing. Please fix this problem. I am frankly going to give up if this problem pursists.\n","\n","253)Pros: lots of characters to meet, lore to discover, areas to explore, story to read. Cons: the endgame. Holy bleep the endgame is a grindy RNG fest. It's hard to get excited for a new character when it'll take 12+ hours just to get them to a usable state. Artifacts are RNG-ception and Hoyoverse has declined to put in any of the quality of life elements from Honkai Impact that made the RNG for stigma less painful. You can't skip the domains either. The headache is real.\n","\n","254)Ever since sumeru update my game is always crashing, it's so frustrating I can't explore and the event has a time limit and this problems of yours are making me disinterest. Anymore than this and I'm quitting, been a player since 1.3 and I'm reaching my limit, I'm been on my burn out stage since sumeru was released.\n","\n","255)I'm going to give this game a 3 stars until Genshin fix the hard and irritating puzzles, it's too hard to solve, and it's really irritating and it ruined the fun. Can Genshin please make the puzzles eazier to solve? But, besides the puzzle, everything is pretty good.\n","\n","256)Ok, I know your wondering why I'm putting 3 stars but I'll tell you why. So overall the game is great but sometimes it's very annoying like glitches. But the thing that annoys me the most is when I only haven't played for ONE day and suddenly \"Oh! YOu NeED TO DowNLOaD 33.47 Mb.\" NO! I HAVE ONLY BEEN OFF THE GAME FOR ONE DAY AND YOU WANT ME TO DOWNLOAD IT WHEN I ALREADY DID!?! YE SO THATS THE REASON WHY I GIVE IT 3 STAR! Oh and well you look at that, ITS STUCK ON 9.04%!!!!\n","\n","257)Artifact RNG in general is terrible, but what I hate the most about it is the drops. Allow us to choose what artifact set we want to get before farming the domain. Imagine if this nonsense also happened with talent book domains, I don't think anyone would even play this game. I can't count how many times I got the wrong set back-to-back, all the other artifact RNG is still terrible but this one frustrates me the most because it's such a simple thing to fix.\n","\n","258)Well, I can't really make an experience, when I can't even play the game because of \"inefficient storage\" and the game looks nice from other prospective's, but like, how much storage does this game need, cause I can't play it\n","\n","259)Been playing this game for almost 2 years, it's a great game but it has a lot of cons. The sumeru update just released and the story already feels rushed and it doesn't stick to its plot or main theme. Sumeru's archon is actually terrible and her personality is cringe too. Since Sumeru is based off of Arab, Egyptian, and Indian culture, I feel like the archon shouldn't be a literal glow stick. There is a lack of representation for tan, brown, and dark skin people of color in their OWN REGION.\n","\n","260)Give it 3 stars because when combat gets hectic, the touch screen controls fail me all the time. The camera also always moves it's way closest to the ground so I constantly have to keep fixing it while fighting. PLEASE BRING MOBILE CONTROLLER SUPPORT TO THIS GAME ITS A MUST FOR THESE TYPES OF GAMES WHICH HAVE A LOT GOING ON AT ONCE. Playing for more than an hour gives me cramps in my hands and the constant fixing of camera and mis-clicks makes me dread playing it sometimes\n","\n","261)The game is amazing and I love it, but the download is way way too big, as I downloaded the 208MB game from the play store, and then I had to wait literally 3 days for the 1GB files download, and now the stupid update is 4 flipping gigabytes! It's a good game but honestly it is stupidly big download sizes. I'm disappointed 😞\n","\n","262)Amazing game, loads to explore and do and every update there is something new to do and updates come out every 6 weeks. However, the gacha system is awful, even though it is possible to get new characters free to play, it requires either a lot of luck or A LOT of money, it also suffers from not having much to do in the end game, where nothing posses a challange and getting new characters is much harder. Overall its an amazing game, but would be much better if it wasn't for the gacha system\n","\n","263)Still no update on if Android User's can use Controllers, i mean what's the point in putting \"KEY BINDING\" and \"CONTROL MODE\" in the option setting is it's UNUSABLE, we can use 3rd party app, but that will only lead to BANNED... for Christmas sake please let us Android users use controller pls ..\n","\n","264)The chat system is too basic and boring do something about it, there is even the useless option which is when i tap stranger avatar there's an option to mute that player even tho im not his friend that is really none sense feature.\n","\n","265)Adequate game. Lots of limited events with somewhat important story relevance. Lots to do early to late-mid game, bare bones end game. Kind of a stingy company. Playing this game as a whale still ended up really tiresome.\n","\n","266)After playing for 2 years now, I realised it's actually quite boring. The genesis crystals are way to expensive, the anniversary gifts are laughable and the characters are not unique anymore. There are more problems but I am not going into detail\n","\n","267)this game doesn't care about you if you're not Chinese. they don't acknowledge or fix things until CN gaming community is upset. ive been playing this game almost 2 year now. besides that gfx, control/movement,art, open world adventure, puzzle is 10/10\n","\n","268)3 star for overpriced outfits it cost 10 wishes for the summon is really not worth it, but the game really fun costly amount of money hopefully developers change the price before get another backlash again\n","\n","269)Pros: nice graphics, great storyline, character designs, combat, maps, music Cons: end game content is nearly nonexistent. Overpriced stuff and the gacha system of this game is pretty bad. Especially if you are f2p or low spender. The artifact rates are bad too. These problems are addressed continuously by the community and there have been no changes whatsoever. In conclusion, great potential but the management of the game is terrible.\n","\n","270)This game is open world and can be quite fun however, most over time it starts to lose its appeal. Some of the quests that you do later in game are teidous and difficult and sometimes it blocks co-op until you finish the quest and it won't let you exit the quest. As for the characters, they're fun to grind for, but the way the app gives you nothing to even get the characters is brutal. The game is mostly P2W and the company and community are toxic. The app also takes up a LOT of space.\n","\n","271)Been playing for years but.. it is the best mobile game ever. The events and updates are always coming so you never run out of things to do. I really respect their hard work and effort into keeping us going with content. But I'm annoyed as someone who buys only on this game that it's one of the few that doesn't accept play points that we rack up from purchasing in their game to use when making even more buys. Just seems stingy they had option for all of about a day or two then gone\n","\n","272)please add option to change bday...was stupid to set bday the next day after creation of account\n","\n","273)This game want me to delete every apps on my phone so 3 stars\n","\n","274)it says i have insufficent space..... i have enough space to store 15 more games idk what to do now help! :(\n","\n","275)Sucks in gacha not getting cyno even 50+ pulls😔\n","\n","276)I do like the game I'd give it a 5 stars but the reason i gave 3 stars is because there's so much graphics that my mobile hangs and dosent turn on,second it takes up 12 gb space\n","\n","277)More content but sumeru is very poorly designed\n","\n","278)As a end game player i kinda feel bad for new players getting the character they want but can't even ascend/upgrade them because they haven't unlock the necessary region for the materials the character needs.it usually take months to get to next region(only if you don't skip dialogues or quests)\n","\n","279)This game is pure gold....but the only problem is the download size! That's the reason it lost 2 stars\n","\n","280)I like this game, but it could been less greedy with f2p\n","\n","281)Boring after a while. No innovation in gameplay mechanics and overall boring events. Too much talking going on.\n","\n","282)It is a beautiful game in fact, but the amount of space it takes is ridiculous utterly ridiculous\n","\n","283)The gb is too big and the graphics are super bad in my device there's no grass even and I can't see any dmg plus the lag 😭😭\n","\n","284)Gonna raise this to 3 star since hoyoverse heard our concerns and did change on our suggestions, but here why not 5 star ratings? Well as you can see another bugs coming, making the game more complicated and they didnt even make every single items clear to understand and, hoyoverse make us like a lobby that we can hang out and do fun stuff, and the resins is still 160, that sucks because there are many weekly bosses and that will make us \"players\" be bored asf that some spend money on your game\n","\n","285)bruh hoyo i played ur game since low AR and now AR57 and never win soft pity and the artifact always give not good stat can u fixx ur game im tired farming just to get trashh\n","\n","286)Fun game sadly can't get meny characters due to rng if unlucky u get alot of the same\n","\n","287)After the new update, I am trying to open the game but it's stuck at applying 100% of update. Please help me.\n","\n","288)So I got a new phone and it says I need to clear my storage and I have like noting on it and it's really annoying\n","\n","289)The game was quite fun, but the game also take quite a big space from my storage.\n","\n","290)The developer's just dont give us feedback ... At all. Tech Otakus Ignore The World Edit:same as last year anniversary rewards are bad for such a successful game. And no buffs/fixes on old characters\n","\n","291)To start this off this game is insanely fun. But the amount of racism the devil show is crazy. For example in Sumeru, which is supposed to be based on the middle east, they basically cut up the people there into 2 different people one of which is white and the other is only slightly darker. And they make the darker people lighter than the darkest Chinese characters not even try8ng to make the sumerians have middle-eastern skin tones.\n","\n","292)Game Is Good I Mean Awsome But YOu Know is Kinda Gayishh\n","\n","293)After all your quests are done there is nothing to do in the game just same things everyday... it's boring now\n","\n","294)The game is amazing bt i think they should do something for the storage system like a cloud storage so that we dont need 16gb space for the game and more people will play this game.\n","\n","295)My account got hacked and i got no response for almost 1 month, NO RESPONSE AT ALL MEANWHILE YOU SAYS THAT YOU WILL DO YOUR JOB DONE FOR 20 DAYS MAX AND I STILL GOT NO RESPONSE. Be careful guys if your account got hacked this is what will happen. Atleast after 26 days i got response and got my account back thankyou hoyoverse, but still the way you handle problems are extremely bad because it takes too long with no response at all. Hope you fix your security and services system asap.\n","\n","296)Funny thing,after the 3.1 update I can't even play the game\n","\n","297)Really fun game with amazing characters that let you make amazing teams. But thats the issue, been playing since launch and ive honestly had enough of my bad luck. Watching everyone around you get characters you want while you grind really hard for them and not getting them in the end yourself sucks bad and it builds up over time. I reccomend this game for sure but only if you can cope with not being able to play who you want unless you pay crazy amounts of money.\n","\n","298)It's a really good game overall. Character designs, events, lore, animation, art, styles, music, etc. But man... I really hate when sometimes I had to redownload the whole app and files when updating is this a bug or what please tell me how to fix it thank you.\n","\n","299)bruh I keep losing the 50/50... I hate diluc\n","\n","300)I don't know why, but I think genshin is the one who made my screen broken\n","\n","301)14GB download is not good for just a phone game\n","\n","302)Used to play this game but with the new updates its hard to even want to play due to the storage issue. I can only play mobile and not having storage is a major issue. please fix this because I cant buy another device with my income.\n","\n","303)There is not a lot of things to late game other then waiting for your resin to refill and go artifact farming.\n","\n","304)It's a cool game and all BUT THE REWARDS ARE TERRIBLE\n","\n","305)The end game isn't fun\n","\n","306)Five star just because of \"You are the star of my night sky\"please forget the comrade Not gonna lie after some time you feel bored doing the same thing everyday after the main quest is over\n","\n","307)somewhat boring but still a great game\n","\n","308)im in a toxic relationship with this game.\n","\n","309)too hard to get primos, too hard to build pity\n","\n","310)i hate this game\n","\n","311)I really like this game, but before, why was my account hacked?😭😭😭\n","\n","312)I've been really enjoying this game so far, though after installing the 3.1 update, the app exits itself after the loading screen. I know for sure that my wifi and my data are not the problem, I also play this game on an android if that helps. I'm not sure if this is just me or a common problem, but I would definitely like some help on this!\n","\n","313)Epic game!\n","\n","314)Fun game, but the drop rates for characters are miniscule. Don't play this if you are a completionist. Once you've completed the quest lines, your ability to get a new drop is limited to about one every 2 days, which will never be enough to get the monthly characters which have a drop rate of .3 percent. I went and upped my fire emblem heroes rating because I thought their drop rate was bad, but this is ridiculous.\n","\n","315)I think the new patch needs fixing, while trying to open waypoints on the desert of sumeru the map kept on glitching. It was difficult to navigate the area because i can't see where i am going due to these glitches\n","\n","316)Still a hit or miss. The free to play rewards are improving as seen on the hoyolab events, but it's still not enough to warrant continue playing. Its very abysmal compared to the time spent on the game, but for me i'll continue playing bc i like the aesthetic, the designs, the music and the gameplay. So far it's not been that bad.\n","\n","317)I really love this game back then but now at ar 55 it's become boring we got 160 resins and each single resin refill with in 8 minutes which is probably 21 hours to refill all resins. How we supposed to farm Mora, level up book ,artifacts , talent level up books, wepon level up materials and world bosses with just 160 resins . This game feels like surviving a hell for f2p players like me\n","\n","318)Wish system is not fair\n","\n","319)Don't waste your money on this game\n","\n","320)i can barely keep genshin on my phone, i hope the size of the game will be reduced\n","\n","321)I love the lore and the fighting style of the game, but the biggest issue I have is the color representation. There are little to no black characters in this game and that irritates me a lot.\n","\n","322)I love the game, it's very fun and I play it everyday. I do have one major issue with the game however. I don't know why this happens but whenever certain characters/parts of sumeru are on screen, I can barely see and this makes the game very hard to play. for example, when I go to sumeru, the whole screen glitches in most parts, the game is still functional but I cannot see anything at all. also certain characters like davalin, Yun Jin, and Signora have a very similar effect. Please fix this!\n","\n","323)While very slow at first and it tries to make you spend money (which I am guilty of) It's fun to level up characters and combine their elements to make reactions. Playing meta CAN be fun if not taken too seriously. Sometimes though, the game can REALLY test your paitence with some battles and sidequests, like when they make you search for something without marking it on the map in massive areas. Just be prepared for some aspects that can be frustrating. Good game otherwise\n","\n","324)Look the game is fun for the most part, but this is twice now it has dumped my account after not letting me email verify. I was almost at level 26 this last time and it was really frustrating to log on and it start from the beginning. I am trying to verify to sync it so it doesn't happen a 3rd time and nothing happens when I hit send code. *edit* I am loving this game. The story is so involved, and the puzzles can be quite tricky at times. I even have a few that are pinned for later.\n","\n","325)Game is pretty fun and has a good base, but the lack of endgame content outside of artifact farming(gear equipment) and spiral abyss makes this game feel empty once you complete the daily commissions, use up resin, and have already challenged the abyss for the current rotation. I don't expect anything related to endgame be implemented in the near future. But, with how the game's story is slowly inching towards the end, something new and permanent would be nice.\n","\n","326)Genshin Impact keeps you entertained and unable to set your phone down. It's interactive and provides multiple quests to go on. The graphics are aesthetically pleasing as well. Only issue is the quick battery drain with long periods of playing. It's to be expected though. Definitely recommend this app when you want to kill some time.\n","\n","327)I took a hiatus from the game after the messy first anniversary. I'm more of a seasonal player now; my goal is to do the events and gather lore. Stellar art direction, gameplay mechanics, music, environment, story, and characters. Resin cap needs to be doubled (320), and cost should be halved (20), at the very least. As a result of the resin limitation, artifacts still being heavily RNG is extremely frustrating. Events should be archived so players can view it again, since they're full of lore.\n","\n","328)I've been playing this game s lot and I really like it. The graphics are amazing, it keeps my mind engaged with all the lore and missions. It's a game that takes a little bit of strategy to play, so you won't just be aimlessly running g around in it. Only thing bad I really have to say is that it doesn't have a pause button (in co-op mode, that is)\n","\n","329)Genshin Impact prides itself on story and exploration, the only problem I have is the lack of a skip button for story and cutscenes. There were times where a story boss took me a while to beat. In these occasions, I had to go through the same unskippable cut scenes, dialogue, and tedious boss phases just to get another shot at the part I mainly have trouble on. Besides that, The game is great and is, to an extent, very F2P freindly. So far, at AR 35, it has yet to feel P2W. But is tough at times\n","\n","330)Loads of gameplay and NO paywall holding you back like many games. My only complaint is that for as long as this game has existed, and as long as I've been asking, there is still no inverted y-axis controls for PC and mobile. It exists for anything with a controller, but nothing else.\n","\n","331)Great game, can't complain about much. I have 2 problems though. 1. Controls are difficult on mobile, especially using bow characters. 2. I can't minimize the game to open another app for even a second or it'll likely crash. Please optimize the game so I can minimize the game for a minute to open another app\n","\n","332)Not sure if anyone has the same problem but as a mobile (tablet) player, the touch screen at the right side is so irritating. I have to swipe with my finger like three times to rotate. This problem was not there till i updated the game to 3.0! Please fix it. And please please put controller support for the android version! It's just not fair if it's only for ios.\n","\n","333)this game is absolutely incredible, the only issue I have isnt really the game's fault. since my phone is god awful every time I'm doing a serious challenge like an ascension challenge it always crashes just when I'm about to finish it. I'd love it if you were able to spawn back into the domain or elemental trial to pick up where you left off.\n","\n","334)Been playing since launch and I've spent hours and real money on this game more than I've spent on any other games. I am satisfied but not perfectly satisfied as I was. I understand it could get repetitive and events that you don't want to do or feel lazy to do so(haven't missed any btw) what I like the most is the plot and storyline, the completeness feela of the game. Every patch feels some device/computer set up are starting to feel the pressure on this game, especially Sumeru update.\n","\n","335)It is a good game I enjoyed a lot playing it. These days mobile games are so boring but this game nails it the game is having a bit of bug which is annoying like Fps dropping from 60 to 40 After 30 mins of playing and the controls don't work properly when you are attacking your enemy even my phone gets too hot playing it even in low settings or in higher settings which don't make sense so fix this problem leaving the rest everything is good.\n","\n","336)It's a good game but crazy expensive too get characters and level them. Biggest gripe is that the camera moves around during battles so that half the time the view is blocked by grass, rocks or buildings. I know it's to be cinematic and works well on flat ground but incredibly annoying on other terrain and screwed me over a few times on bosses. Please give option to turn it off.\n","\n","337)The game seems good in all aspects but there are some bug like freezing of health and stamina bar something when attacking enemy even if I get get damage. Stamina of the players should be little longer because it is very difficult to swim and climb high clifs.Please fix this.\n","\n","338)The rank ascendsions shouldn't be so much of a frustration to just continue the storyline and seem to be a way of getting players to quit playing due to difficulty. Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely game, but to do thr storyline only for there to be places where adventure rank locks seems counterproductive when it is used to progress story\n","\n","339)No controller support for Androids. That is the only disappointment. Other than that it's a good game and I play mainly on my PC rather than mobile because the mobile version is not really efficient and the play style is not great either which would be easier if I have a controller and I do except it doesnt support controller for Androids which I think is unfair. If you have controller support for iPhone why not Androids as well.\n","\n","340)Exploring sumeru has a lot of issues like it lags, the area becomes blurred, I can't teleport to anywhere(is it just me or teleportation becomes unavailable once I'm in sumeru) and this just happens in sumeru, and nowhere else. But otherwise the game is sooo good, this is the first time im addicted to a game in a long time and I rarely play games. The story is addicting, you always yearn to know what will happen next, especially with finding our sibling.Love the game.Would Totally recommend it.\n","\n","341)I really enjoy genshin impact, it is an amazing game with loads of places to explore. But a major problem is that by the time you're AR (adventure rank) 45, playing the game isn't as fun as playing the game as lower AR.\n","\n","342)I loved the game, but sometimes it gets boring. Just doing quest and farming domains. It keeps crashing. Every 5 minutes or so please stop the crashing in the mobile , and I have something new to say. Think my account got hacked, I haven't played the game in a while. Actually just 2 weeks, or at least a month. Just because I keep farm and doing quests, which is boring to me. But I still love the game devastated. Because I can't log in. Putting in my email and old password not working 😭😭😭😭bye\n","\n","343)I've been playing genshin impact from version 2.6. Everything was fine. I loved everything of the game. But after the 3.0 update, the game often suffers crashes. The game never crashed before. It's suddenly crashing a lot. Please fix this problem.\n","\n","344)Gg game\n","\n","345)After the update. Some of the graphics are just pitch black and these makes me unable to progress the desert world nicely. I think maybe this only works on mobile players, please fix this.\n","\n","346)end game\n","\n","347)good game, but the gacha system is very awful\n","\n","348)I like all the verity of the game and characters\n","\n","349)i luv the game but i have loads of storag and it sill wont let me:(\n","\n","350)Game is okey but i no have 5 star hero\n","\n","351)I've only got one problem. I can't get into my account and I've lost anything but other than that it's my favorite game 😊\n","\n","352)Some of my character is missing in this game. I don't know why please help me...\n","\n","353)Anniversary rewards are horrible, they dont care about their players at all, would advice against playing the game untill they make some changes..\n","\n","354)I wish it optimise in lower device phone to play everyone with no high end phone\n","\n","355)The game gud but soooo heavy on mobile\n","\n","356)I rate 4 because when i try to play this game the graphics is laggy and the game story sometimes cut scene when i try to record or not record ít still the same laggy i tried the wishing event its kinda not fair to get 50/50 wish sometimes is lucky by on ur day maybe u should give thoé new players some luck maybe 4 stars or weapons for them hope u can give them some luck.\n","\n","357)It is very fun but quests are anoying and they dont give enough info sometimes also they are very repetitive along with the rest of the game\n","\n","358)Google Play said I would like this game and I do. A lot. I jumped up grabbed my PlayStation 4 controller. My heart got broken. So far really great game I would put five stars if my PlayStation 4 controller would have been compatible.\n","\n","359)I'm sad to say but the game has force stopped twice while I was wishing which lead to me not getting anything from the wish, and losing 320 primogems, but otherwise I love the newest update it was very well done, and I hope you guys can get that patched!\n","\n","360)The game is great, but it takes up a lot of storage and the representation for dark-skinned people is HORRIBLE.\n","\n","361)I like the characters at this game and its very interesting i don't get to log in that much because of school it's getting boring to when you reach an higher ar but this game is ok 👍 recc this\n","\n","362)The game is great, look at all the other reviews they are absolutely correct, the only negatives you see are ppl with ancient phones and anti-asian/white sentiments. the community is toxic, fragile and boring.\n","\n","363)I love the story the characters and the map but the fact that Co op is in the game I am not much of a fan\n","\n","364)I've tried to stop playing this game but I can't stop coming back, it's got lots of flaws, namely the horrid gacha rates, but it's still a pretty fun game\n","\n","365)Extremely boring game.. got burnt out in a month\n","\n","366)very fun, though the grind is very difficult.\n","\n","367)The game is addicting, especially the early game experience; there is so much to do so much to explore and the stories are compelling but sometimes not written the best, late-game experince gets particularly boring; you just log in do dailys use resin, wish do story/events and leave, since I'm AR56 I've done majority of things but other then late game being boring it's a good game you should play (P.S. avoid the fandom they're weird)\n","\n","368)Really sad I must quit genshin because my memory won't enough 💔 but still good game tho\n","\n","369)Im AR 35 and i dont even have one single 5 star character 🥲\n","\n","370)Great game, the open world aspect is very well handled. Leveling up in adventure rank is a chore but isn't that bad. Best thing is that paying money to wish isn't required, you can get new characters and progress through the game without spending anything and it isn't even pushed on you to spend money, it's just an option.\n","\n","371)i adore the game ! i love the graphics and the characters. the only problem i ever run into is that my game crashes consistently, and the only way to fix it is by restarting my phone. i don't really complain, as i figured it was just a problem with my phone as it has not happened to the other mobile players i've known.\n","\n","372)Gave this game another try and it has definitely grown on me. I did have to google some tips because its not very clear on how to use every item you find/collect for upgrading etc. They dont make it easy to transfer game files across platforms so be cautious when starting your game file on different consoles. The graphics and open world experience is amazing. The music is really relaxing and makes the game chill.\n","\n","373)A rare game where you can also play on pc and consoles. Play on those platforms when possible unless you are on the go. The game is actually f2p or low spender friendly since theres nothing to prevent you in the story progression. Unless you want to collect many 5 star characters and weapons then you'd need to swipe and the price point is definitely on the premiums tier. Nevertheless the game excels in graphic,music, story, exploration, and character development. Truly a game that set apart.\n","\n","374)Overall the game's good and the characters are pretty fun to play too, there are also events that keep you busy even though only for a few days. Though... I would like to say that, maybe it's me that's too fast, but everytime after I finish an event, it feels like there's nothing left to do except doing commissions and domains everyday. It gets pretty boring as it repetitively is like that.. But! Since it feels like it is my own fault, this game is still a recommend! edit: CYNOOOOOO CANDACEEEEEE\n","\n","375)I LIVE FOR THIS GAME!!! I started playing it around March or April and now it's pretty much the only game I ever play! So addictive and I love the design of the scenery, quests and characters! Everything is so realistic and beautiful and the animation quality is appalling! Ever since I was little I wanted an animation game with graphics like these and when I saw my friend playing it, it instantly caught my eye and I was so attracted to it I haven't not played a single day yet!\n","\n","376)No words can explain how amazing the game is, the graphics, the characters, the story, but there is a problem, collecting primogems is a bit hard. there is a quest called \"In the mountains\" It's too hard and it takes a lot of effort, stay close to the fire and fight 3 robots! in the end I get 40 primogems. Please can you make collecting it a bit easier? Thank you so much for your hard work💕\n","\n","377)The characters and gameplay are great. The only issue I have with the game is that there is not enough things to do, because there are only a few quests and the resin system restricts you to run instas. How I play nowadays is I am skipping a few weeks and then before the patch ends I catch up. This way I spend less and I have a lot of things to do.\n","\n","378)This game is a big leap for mobile gaming. The other games were as I would call them \"a work in progress\". But, this this game is advanced in controls. This was meant for PS4, XBOX and PC but the developers worked hard to bring this game to Mobile players and they did not sacrifice a feature the game is almost as same as the one on consoles and pc. Best Graphics, gameplay and storyline. Must download!\n","\n","379)This game is very fun,has been playing it ever since the game release.The few problem I had is when I play in mobile it lag all the time and the game hasn't load properly that my characters somehow go though the ground and died.There's also an issue in the cut scenes, every time a cut scenes comes up the audio and the visual lag hardly that I can't even know what it saying and have to go to YouTube to rewatch the scenes.Hope mihoyo can fix these problems for all of us mobile user. Edit:is fixed\n","\n","380)I have enjoyed this game so much since then moment I've started playing. I play on both ps4 and Mobile and it works so well. The game has amazing storyline, game play and character design. The game is still in development however I've never experienced any bugs personally and have been playing for a bit. The game also works fairly well with bad wifi meaning it doesn't restrict many players from being able to play.\n","\n","381)I loooove its game play\n","\n","382)This game is iteading and fun.\n","\n","383)Wide world\n","\n","384)Op game\n","\n","385)it's really a adventure game and I like it\n","\n","386)Very nice, like this game a lot, except Xiao. I hate him\n","\n","387)Recommend game\n","\n","388)pls stop updating ur game\n","\n","389)I cannot play it because it is still updating and it's so long to be update\n","\n","390)This game is very very nice but update is 18 GB data this is bad but not problem I am play\n","\n","391)Update: Issue resolved! ¦¦ Sad that they didn't address the mobile issue in their recent development notes. Looks like it's an issue among Samsung Note 10 Lite users. Wish Mihoyo would fix this. Game wouldn't load properly since the last update, especially for mobile. Stuck in the white screen of death.\n","\n","392)I was gonna play this game but now the download resource data is 18 GB man\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# plot the polarity and
